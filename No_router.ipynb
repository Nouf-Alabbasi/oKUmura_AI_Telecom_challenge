The edge enabler layer\\nexposes APIs to support such capabilities.\\n\\nThe edge computing capabilities supported by 3GPP are illustrated in the\\nfigure\\xa04.1-1.\\n\\nFigure\\xa04.1-1: Overview of 3GPP edge computing\\n\\nThe application layer is a consumer of 3GPP specified edge computing\\ncapabilities. The 3GPP edge computing capabilities are typically\\norganized as follows:\\n\\n- Edge enabler layer, specified in this specification;\\n\\n- Edge hosting environment, details of which are outside the scope of\\n3GPP;\\n\\n- 3GPP transport layer, specified in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.401\\xa0[11] and\\n3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2]; and\\n\\n- Edge management layer, specified in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa028.538 [22].\\n\\nFollowing clauses provide an overview of the features of edge enabler\\nlayer.\\n\\nThe edge computing features defined in this specification are applicable\\nto PLMN(s) and to SNPN(s) as 3GPP transport layer. In this\\nspecification, when PLMN is mentioned, it is also applicable for SNPN\\nunless stated otherwise.\\n\\n4.2 Service provisioning\\n\\nService provisioning procedures supply the information required by the\\nUE to access the edge services. The procedure takes UE\\'s location,\\nservice requirements, service preferences and connectivity information\\ninto account to provide the required configuration. Service provisioning\\nprocedures are specified in clause\\xa08.3.\\n\\n4.3 Registration\\n\\nRegistration procedures specified in clause 8.4, allow entities (e.g. UE\\nand Application Server) in the edge enabler layer to provide information\\nabout itself to other entities of the edge enabler layer.\\n\\n4.4 EAS discovery\\n\\nEAS discovery procedures enable the UE to obtain information about\\nsuitable EASs of interest (specified as discovery filters) in the EDN.\\nEAS discovery procedures are specified in clause\\xa08.5.\\n\\n4.5 Capability exposure to EAS and EEC\\n\\nThe edge enabler layer exposes services towards the EASs and EECs. The\\nexposed capabilities include the services of the Edge Enabler Layer and\\nthe re-exposed and enhanced services of the 3GPP core network. The\\ncapabilities exposed by the edge enabler layer are specified in\\nclause\\xa08.6 and the 3GPP network capability exposure is specified in\\nclause\\xa08.7. Other application layer capabilities like application\\nenabler services and SEAL services may be exposed via edge enabler layer\\nas per CAPIF as illustrated in Annex A.4.\\n\\nThe edge enabler layer also supports for an EAS to expose its Service\\nAPIs (i.e., EAS Service APIs) towards the other EASs via CAPIF as\\nspecified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6] by deploying CAPIF core function within\\nthe EES to support publish and discovery of EAS Service APIs. The\\ndetails are provided in Annex A.5.4.\\n\\n4.6 Support for service continuity\\n\\nWhen a UE moves to a new location, different EASs can be more suitable\\nfor serving the UE. When no suitable EAS can be found for serving the\\nUE, the service session may transition to a CAS. Such transitions can\\nresult from a non-mobility event also, requiring support from the edge\\nenabler layer to maintain the continuity of the service. Support for\\nservice continuity provides several features for minimizing the\\napplication layer service interruption by replacing the S-EAS connected\\nto the AC in the UE, with a T-EAS or CAS. Support for service continuity\\nis further specified in clause\\xa08.8.\\n\\n4.7 Security\\n\\nThe edge enabler layer supports secure communication amongst the enabler\\nlayer entities. Clause\\xa08.11 provides details on EEC authentication and\\nauthorization.\\n\\n4.8 Dynamic EAS instantiation triggering\\n\\nThe Edge Enabler Layer can interact with the ECSP management system to\\ntrigger instantiation of a suitable EAS as per application needs.\\nDetails of the EAS instantiation triggering are specified in\\nclause\\xa08.12.\\n\\n4.9 Charging\\n\\nThe general architecture and principles applicable for charging of Edge\\nenabling services provided by an ECSP to an ASP, is specified in\\n3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa032.240\\xa0[24].\\n\\n5 Architectural requirements \\n\\n5.1 General\\n\\nThis clause specifies architectural requirements for enabling edge\\napplications in different functional aspects.\\n\\n5.2 Architectural requirements\\n\\n5.2.1 General

UE\\nID can be:\\n\\na) a GPSI, as defined in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2].\\n\\nNOTE\\xa01: For user\\'s privacy reasons, GPSI in the form of MSISDN can be\\nused only after obtaining user\\'s consent.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa02: To protect user\\'s privacy, if MSISDN cannot be used then\\nAF-specific UE ID which is a GPSI in the form of an External ID may\\neither be acquired through the NEF\\'s Nnef_UEId_Get service operation\\n(see TS 23.502 clause\\xa04.15.10) or other out of scope means (e.g.\\npre-configuration).\\n\\nb) an EEL-generated Edge UE ID, as defined in clause 7.2.9\\n\\n7.2.7 UE Group ID\\n\\nThe UE Group ID uniquely identifies a group of UE within a PLMN domain.\\nFollowing identities are examples that can be used:\\n\\na) internal group ID, as defined in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2]; and\\n\\nb) external group ID, as defined in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2].\\n\\n7.2.8 EEC Context ID\\n\\nThe EEC Context ID is a globally unique value which identifies a set of\\nparameters associated with the EEC (e.g., due to registration) and\\nmaintained in the Edge Enabler Layer by EESs.\\n\\nIf the EEC registration request does not include a previously assigned\\nEEC Context ID value, the receiver EES assigns a new EEC Context ID and\\ncreates an EEC Context as described in the Table 8.2.8-1.\\n\\nProviding a previously assigned EEC Context ID at registration allows\\nmaintaining the EEC Context in the Edge Enabler Layer beyond the\\nlifetime of a registration, subject to policies. If the EEC registration\\nrequest does include a previously assigned EEC Context ID value, after\\nEEC Context relocation, the receiver EES may assign a new EEC Context\\nID, subject to implementation and local policies.\\n\\nNOTE: The EEC Context ID may be implemented as combination of other IDs\\n(e.g., EES ID and registration ID). How the EEC Context ID is specified\\nor assigned is out of scope of this specification.\\n\\n7.2.9 Edge UE ID\\n\\nThe Edge UE ID is an identifier that is associated with the UE ID (GPSI\\nas per clause 7.2.6) and managed by EES. The EES can generate Edge UE ID\\nas needed (e.g. as per ECSP policy). Edge UE ID can be shared with the\\nEAS directly (using UE Identifier API as per clause 8.6.5) and/or\\nindirectly via AC (using UE ID request as per clause 8.14.2.6) in order\\nfor it to be used by the EAS over EDGE-3 interactions when it is not\\ndesired to share the UE ID (GPSI as per clause 7.2.6) with the EAS. The\\nEdge UE ID can be temporary to limit the access of the EAS when needed.\\n\\nNOTE: The Edge UE ID is not applicable for EDGE-7 interactions.\\n\\n7.2.10 EAS bundle information \\n\\nThe EAS bundle information includes EAS bundle type, a list of EASIDs or\\na EAS bundle ID. The EAS bundle information may also include main EASID\\nand EAS bundle requirements. EAS bundle ID establishes an association\\nbetween the EASs. When included in the EAS profile, EAS bundle ID\\ndenotes the bundle to which the EAS belongs. When included in the AC\\nprofile EAS bundle ID is used to perform different Edge Enabler Layer\\noperations, such as EAS discovery. Edge Enabler Layer handles the EASs\\nbelonging to the same bundle as required by related EAS bundle\\nrequirements as described in clause\\xa08.2.10.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa01: Both EAS bundle ID and EAS bundle requirements are provided by\\nthe ASP.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa02: Bundle ID is necessary when the affinity between bundled EASs is\\nstrong (e.g., co-deployment and co-migration is essential) and the\\nrelated ASPs, which provide the AC and bundled EASs, established the\\nbundle. List of EASIDs is required when the affinity between the bundled\\nEASs is weak (e.g., co-deployment and co-migration is only \"nice to\\nhave\").\\n\\nNOTE 3: Following types of EAS bundles are considered in this release:\\n\\n- Direct bundle, where AC interacts with multiple EASs of the EAS bundle\\ndirectly with no coordination between the EASs; and\\n\\n- Proxy bundle, where the AC interacts with one EAS of the EAS bundle\\nwhich in turn coordinates with other EASs of the EAS bundle to provide\\nservices to the AC by exchanging Application Data Traffic with the other\\nEASs, which is out-of-scope of this specification.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa04: Discovery of EAS Service APIs via CAPIF for the proxy bundle\\ntype is not considered in this release.\\n\\n7.2.11 Application Group ID\\n\\nApplication Group ID uniquely identifies a group of UEs using the same\\napplication. It is allocated (either dynamically or pre-configured in\\nthe AC) by the ASP and is unique within the application. ACs supporting\\nthe same application on different OS (e.g., iOS, Android), and therefore\\ndiffering ACIDs (as specified in clause 7.2.5), can have the same\\nApplication Group ID.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa01: In this version of specification, Application Group ID is\\nassumed to be unique per EAS ID. Ensuring the uniqueness of the\\nApplication Group ID per EAS ID is out of scope of this specification.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa02: In this version of specification, an Application Group is\\nassumed to correspond to a single application.\\n\\n7.3 Commonly used values\\n\\n7.3.1 General\\n\\n7.3.2 UE location\\n\\nThe UE location identifies where the UE is connected to the network or\\nthe position of the UE. It provides consistent definition of the UE\\'s\\nlocation across the UE and network entities. Following values are\\nexamples of UE locations that can be used:\\n\\na) Cell Identity, Tracking Area Identity, GPS Coordinates or civic\\naddresses as defined in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.502\\xa0[3] clause\\xa04.15.3.\\n\\n7.3.3 Service areas\\n\\n7.3.3.1 General\\n\\nECSPs and ASPs may allow access to Edge Computing service from specific\\nareas i.e. allowing only the UEs within that area to access functional\\nentities resident in the EDN. This area is called service area.\\n\\nSome functional elements make decisions based on the topological\\nlocation of the UE, (e.g. the cell it is connected to) while others make\\ndecisions based on the UE\\'s geographical location (e.g. its geographical\\ncoordinates).\\n\\nFunctional elements that are aware of both topological and geographical\\ninformation can translate one value to the other.\\n\\n7.3.3.2 Topological Service Area\\n\\nA Topological Service Area is defined in relationship with a UE\\'s point\\nof connection to the network, such as: a collection of Cell IDs,\\nTracking Area Identities or the PLMN ID. Any UE that is attached to the\\nCore Network from a cell whose ID is in this list, can be served by the\\nfunctional entity in the EDN that is configured to serve that\\nTopological Service Area.\\n\\nNOTE: Topological Service Area information is not applicable for\\nuntrusted functional elements (EESs and/or EASs deployed outside the MNO\\ntrust domain).\\n\\n7.3.3.3 Geographical Service Area\\n\\nA Geographical Service Area is an area that is specified by geographical\\nunits as defined in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.032\\xa0[21], such as: Geographical\\ncoordinates, an area that is defined as a circle whose centre is denoted\\nby geographical coordinates, an area that is defined by a polygon whose\\ncorners are denoted by geographical coordinates. A Geographical Service\\nArea can also be expressed in other ways such as: a well-known\\nbuildings, parks, arenas, civic addresses or ZIP code etc.\\n\\nApplications can be configured to serve UEs that are in a specified\\ngeographical area and deny service from UEs that are not located in that\\narea.\\n\\nNOTE: Whether and how geographical information is used by applications\\nto provide or deny service is out of scope.\\n\\n7.3.3.4 EDN service area\\n\\nA service area from which the access to the EDN is allowed. ECSPs can\\nuse LADNs, as described in Annex\\xa0A.2.4 of this document, to deploy EDNs\\nwith access restricted from specific areas. When an EDN is deployed\\nusing LADN, the EDN service area is same as the LADN service area and\\nrules specified for LADN apply to the UE, as specified in\\n3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2].\\n\\nIn a deployment using DNs other than LADNs, the EDN service area is the\\nwhole PLMN for non-roaming scenario.\\n\\nNOTE 1: The EDN service area for roaming scenario is out of scope in\\nthis release of the specification.\\n\\nNOTE 2: For the purpose of restricting the access to the EES from\\nspecific areas, ECSP can use the EES service area, which is specified in\\nclause\\xa07.3.3.5, even if the EDN service area is the whole PLMN.\\n\\nThe EDN service area may be expressed as a Topological Service Area.\\n\\n7.3.3.5 EES Service Area\\n\\nA service area from which the access to the EES is allowed. This service\\narea is equal to or a subset of the service area of the EDN in which the\\nEES resides.\\n\\nThe EES service area may be expressed as a Topological Service Area, a\\nGeographical Service Area or both.\\n\\n7.3.3.6 EAS service area\\n\\nA service area from which the access to the EAS is allowed. This service\\narea is equal to or a subset of the service area of the EES which serves\\nthe EAS.\\n\\nThe EAS service area may be expressed as a Topological Service Area, a\\nGeographical Service Area or both.\\n\\n8 Procedures and information flows\\n\\n8.1 General\\n\\nThis clause provides procedures and information flows necessary for\\nenabling edge application including information elements used in the\\nprocedures.\\n\\n8.2 Common Information Elements\\n\\n8.2.1 General\\n\\nThis clause provides descriptions for Information Elements which are\\ncommonly used in several procedures.\\n\\n8.2.2 AC Profile\\n\\nAn AC Profile includes information about AC used to determine services\\nand service characteristics required.\\n\\nNOTE: Information elements in the AC Profile are provided by the ASP.\\n\\nTable\\xa08.2.2-1: AC Profile\\n\\n+-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+\\n| Information element         | Status | Description                 |\\n+-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+\\n| ACID                        | M      | Identity of the AC.         |\\n+-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+\\n| AC Type                     | O      | The category or type of AC  |\\n|                             |        | (e.g. V2X).

This\\nconfiguration includes the necessary address information for the EEC to\\nestablish connection with the EES(s).\\n\\nIf the ECS deployed by MNO is contracted with one or more ECSP(s), the\\nECS provides EES configuration information of MNO owned and ECSP owned\\nEESs via MNO ECS as described in clause\\xa08.3.3.3.3.\\n\\nIf the ECS is deployed by a non-MNO ECSP, the ECS endpoint address may\\nbe configured with the EEC. An EEC that is aware of multiple ECSP\\'s ECS\\nendpoint addresses may perform the service provisioning procedure per\\nECS of each ECSP multiple times.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.3.1-1 illustrates an overview of service provisioning. Service\\nprovisioning procedures support the following models:\\n\\n- Request/Response model; and\\n\\n- Subscribe/Notify model.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.3.1-1: Overview of Service provisioning\\n\\nThe UE is given configuration information enabling it to connect to the\\nECS. The UE can then request initial provisioning from the ECS to obtain\\nconfiguration required to connect to the EDN. Once provisioned, the EEC\\nof the UE registers with the selected EES(s) from the list of\\nprovisioned EES(s) it received from the ECS(s), if the EEC registration\\nconfiguration in EES profile indicates that EEC registration is\\nrequired. The UE further consumes the edge computing services and\\nperforms various operations such as EAS discovery, Edge application\\ncommunications, ACR, etc. While the UE is consuming the edge computing\\nservices, the UE or ECS may be triggered to re-request service\\nprovisioning.\\n\\nThe triggers for service provisioning are classified as:\\n\\na. Triggers at UE - Some examples are:\\n\\n- AC related updates available at the EEC due to AC\\ninstallation/re-installation, AC requesting application server access\\n(e.g. via internet browser);\\n\\n- EEC supporting one or more ACs may be updated due to EEC\\nre-installation; and\\n\\n- Lifetime of EDN Configuration Information is expired or the EEC\\ndetects that the UE moves out of EDN Service Area in the EDN\\nConfiguration Information.\\n\\nb. Triggers at ECS – Some examples are:\\n\\n- EES updates received due to EAS\\ninstallation/re-installation/re-location; and\\n\\n- ECS receives the EDN/DNAI change notification of the UE from 5GC when\\nthe ECS subscribes to the user plane path management events as specified\\nin clause\\xa08.10.2.\\n\\n8.3.2 ECS Discovery\\n\\n8.3.2.1 General\\n\\nECS configuration information consists of one or more endpoint\\ninformation (e.g. URI(s), FQDN(s), IP address(es)) of ECS(s), and\\noptionally the corresponding ECS Provider Identifier. ECS configuration\\ninformation can be\\n\\n- pre-configured with the EEC;\\n\\n- configured by an edge-aware AC;\\n\\n- configured by the user;\\n\\n- provisioned by MNO through 5GC procedure if the UE has the capability\\nto deliver the ECS configuration information to the EEC on the UE (see\\n3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.548\\xa0[20], clause\\xa06.5.2);\\n\\n- derived from HPLMN identifier for non-roaming scenario or from VPLMN\\nidentifier for roaming scenario; or\\n\\n- derived from serving SNPN identifier.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa01: How the ECS configuration information is configured to the EEC\\nuser, or pre-configuration is out of scope of the present specification.\\n\\nIt may be possible to provide the ECS configuration information to the\\nEEC from the 5GC if the UE has the capability to deliver the ECS\\nconfiguration information to the EEC on the UE.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa02: When the AF provides the ECS configuration information to 5GC,\\nthe list of supported PLMN(s) of this ECS configuration information can\\nbe provided together. As described in 3GPP TS 23.548 [20], NFs do not\\nneed to be aware of internal structure of ECS configuration information.\\n\\nIt may be possible to provide the ECS configuration information to the\\nEEC from an edge-ware AC via EDGE-5 reference point within the UE if the\\nAC is configured with the ECS configuration information and can\\ncommunicate with the EEC. When the ECS configuration information is\\nprovided from an AC, the EEC uses the ECS configuration information for\\nthe initial service provisioning for the AC if there is no ECS\\nconfiguration information is provided from the 5GC.\\n\\nIf the ECS configuration information is provided by 5GC and available at\\nthe EEC, the EEC shall use the information for the initial provisioning\\nrequest. Otherwise, the EEC shall use pre-configured ECS address for the\\ninitial provisioning if ECS configuration information is preconfigured\\nwith the EEC.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa03: The ECS configuration information configured by an edge-aware AC\\nis considered to be part of pre-configured ECS configuration information\\nwith the EEC for the AC.\\n\\nTable\\xa08.3.2.1-1 describes the information

Request-response model\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.3.3.2.2-1 illustrates service provisioning procedure based on\\nrequest/response model.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1.

The UE Identifier is either preconfigured or resulted from a\\nsuccessful authorization; and\\n\\n4. The ECS is configured with ECSP\\'s policy for service provisioning.\\n\\nNOTE 1: Details of ECSP\\'s policy are out of scope.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.3.3.2.2-1: Service provisioning – Request/Response\\n\\n1. The EEC sends a service provisioning request to the ECS. The service\\nprovisioning request includes the security credentials of the EEC\\nreceived during EEC authorization procedure and may include the UE\\nidentifier such as GPSI, connectivity information, UE location, EEC\\nservice continuity support and AC profile(s) information. EEC may\\nprovide its desired ECSP identifier(s) in the service provisioning\\nrequest based on EEC preference.\\n\\n2. Upon receiving the request, the ECS performs an authorization check\\nto verify whether the EEC has authorization to perform the operation.\\nThe ECS may utilize the capabilities (e.g. UE location) of the 3GPP core\\nnetwork as specified in clause\\xa08.10.2. If the UE serving PLMN identifier\\nis not provided by the EEC in the connectivity information of the\\nservice provisioning request, the ECS may invoke the NEF monitoring\\nevent API as described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [43] and 3GPP TS 23.682 [17] to\\nobtain the UE roaming status and serving PLMN identifier. If the UE is\\nroaming, the ECS may use the serving PLMN identifier to determine the\\nroaming partner ECS (i.e. V-ECS) information to be provided to the EEC\\nin the service provisioning response. If AC profile(s) are provided by\\nthe EEC, and the Application group profile is not provided, the ECS\\nidentifies the EES(s) based on the provided AC profile(s) and the UE\\nlocation.\\n\\nWhen Application group profile is provided in the request,\\n\\n- if the ECS-ER is not available, then\\n\\n- the ECS identifies EES(s) based on the information contained in the\\nrequest (e.g.AC profile, Application group profile, UE location);\\n\\n- if the ECS-ER is available, and:\\n\\n- EES information is not available corresponding to the Application\\nGroup ID, then the ECS identifies EES(s) and stores the identified\\nEES(s)\\'s information and related Application group ID into the ECS-ER;\\nor\\n\\n- EES information is available corresponding to the Application Group\\nID, then the ECS retrieves the EES (s) information corresponding to the\\nApplication Group ID from the ECS-ER.\\n\\nNOTE 2: It is up to the ASP or the EES to determine validity of the\\napplication group.\\n\\nThe ECS may take Group Geographical Service Area information and KPI\\nrequirements of the AC to determine the EES(s) corresponding to the\\nApplication group ID.\\n\\nWhen neither Application group profile nor AC profiles(s) are provided,\\nthen:\\n\\n- if available, the ECS identifies the EES(s) based on the UE-specific\\nservice information at the ECS and the UE location;\\n\\n- ECS identifies the EES(s) by applying the ECSP policy (e.g. based only\\non the UE location);\\n\\nFurthermore, the ECS may identify the EES based on the EEC service\\ncontinuity support information and EES service continuity support\\ninformation.\\n\\nNOTE 3: Details of the UE-specific service information and how it is\\navailable at the ECS is out of scope.\\n\\nNOTE 4: Both steps are evaluated prior to sending a response.\\n\\nIf desired ECSP identifier(s) is provided by the EEC, the ECS identifies\\nthe EES(s) to be sent in step 3 based on registered ECSP identifier in\\nEES profile and the desired ECSP identifier(s).\\n\\nNOTE\\xa05: For EEC desired ECSP identifier usage, it is assumed that the\\nECSP providing the EES and PLMN operator are the same organization and\\nan ECSP providing the EES (desired by the EEC) registers its EES in ECS\\nprovided by another ECSP based on service agreement to provide services\\nto EEC.\\n\\nThe ECS also determines other information that needs to be provisioned,\\ne.g. identification of the EDN, EDN service area, EES endpoints.\\n\\nIf ECS does not identify any suitable EES(s) based on EDN configuration\\navailable at the ECS and UE\\'s location, the ECS determines a partner ECS\\nthat may satisfy the requirements. Based on ECSP policy, the ECS may use\\npreconfigured or OAM configured information about the partner ECSs or\\nECS discovery via ECS-ER as specified in clause\\xa08.17.2.3 or both.\\n\\nIf required by the ECSP policies, the ECS may use service provisioning\\ninformation retrieval procedure as specified in clause\\xa08.17.2.4 to\\nobtain service provisioning information from the partner ECS.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa06: ECSP policies can restrict sharing partner ECSP\\'s information\\nwith the EEC.\\n\\nWhen the bundle EAS information is provided, then;\\n\\n- If bundle EAS information includes EAS bundle identifier, the ECS\\nidentifies all the EES(s) providing the same EAS bundle identifier.\\n\\n- If bundle EAS information includes a list of EASIDs, the ECS\\nidentifies the one or more EES which support all of the EASs within the\\nsame EDN based on the EDN information obtained in the EES profile.\\n\\n3. If the processing of the request was successful, the ECS responds to\\nthe EEC\\'s request with a service provisioning response. If the ECS has\\nidentified the relevant EES(s) information, the service provisioning\\nresponse includes a list of EDN configuration information, e.g.\\nidentification of the EDN, EDN service area, and the required\\ninformation (e.g. URI, IP address) for establishing a connection to the\\nEES.\\n\\nThe ECS may provide associated EES(s) information (one or more EES\\ninformation) in the service provisioning response along with the bundle\\nEAS information.\\n\\nIf the alternative ECS(s) has been identified in step 2, the ECS sends a\\nsuccessful response including the Redirect information element\\ncontaining the list of ECS(s) configuration information indicating that\\nalternative ECS(s) is available for service provisioning request. The\\nresponse may include information such as DNN and S-NSSAI for roaming UEs\\nto establish a PDU session with the ECS as specified in 3GPP TS 23.548\\n[20].\\n\\nIf the ECS is not provisioned with any EDN configuration information or\\nis unable to determine either the EES information or the partner ECS\\ninformation using the inputs in service provisioning request,\\nUE-specific service information at the ECS or the ECSP\\'s policy, the ECS\\nshall reject the service provisioning request and respond with an\\nappropriate failure cause.\\n\\nIf the service provisioning response contains a list of ECS\\nconfiguration information, the EEC may initiate service provisioning\\nprocedure with one or more ECS(s) provided in the response. If the UE is\\nroaming to a V-PLMN and the ECS configuration information includes\\nV-PLMN ID in the list of Supported PLMN ID(s), the EEC establishes a\\nconnection with the V-ECS as specified in 3GPP TS 23.548 [20]. The\\nconnection with the V-ECS can be a HR-SBO PDU session or an LBO PDU\\nsession based on the information received from the ECS.\\n\\nIf the EDN configuration information includes an LADN DNN as an\\nidentifier for the EDN, the EEC considers the LADN as the EDN.\\nTherefore, the service area of EDN is the LADN Service Area which can be\\ndiscovered using the UE Registration Procedure.\\n\\nThe EEC may cache the service provisioning information (e.g. EES\\nendpoint) for subsequent use and avoid the need to repeat step 1. If the\\nLifetime IE is included in the Service provisioning response, then the\\nEEC may cache and reuse the Service provisioning information only for\\nthe duration specified by the Lifetime IE, without the need to repeat\\nstep\\xa01.\\n\\nIf the ECS provided information regarding the service continuity support\\nof individual EESs, the EEC may take this information into account when\\nselecting an EES for EEC registration, EAS discovery or T-EAS discovery,\\nrespectively.\\n\\nIf for multiple EES(s), the instantiable EAS information IE for an EAS\\nis not available or the instantiable EAS information IE is set to\\ninstantiated or instantiable, the EEC can select one or more such EES to\\nperform EAS discovery. For EAS discovery to mitigate the waste of EDN\\nresources EEC considers the instantiable EAS information and the\\nassociated instantiation criteria, the EEC selects one EES, if the EAS\\ninstantiation status corresponding to the EASID requested by AC/EEC is\\ninstantiable but not yet instantiated (i.e. no instantiated EAS).\\n\\nNOTE 7: If the service provisioning request fails, the EEC can resend\\nthe service provisioning request again, taking into account the received\\nfailure cause.\\n\\nNOTE 8: Even after the EEC establishes a connection to the EES using\\ninformation received in step 3, the EES can issue AF request to\\ninfluence traffic routing from EEC to EES as specified in\\n3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2] clause\\xa05.6.7.\\n\\nNOTE 9: If the EAS instantiation fails based on the selected EES, the\\nEEC may retry the EAS discovery request to another EES (e.g. selecting\\nanother one EES based on the instantiable EAS information).\\n\\n8.3.3.2.3 Subscribe-notify model\\n\\n8.3.3.2.3.1 General\\n\\nClause\\xa08.3.3.2.3.2 and clause\\xa08.3.3.2.3.3 together illustrate the\\nservice provisioning procedure based on Subscribe/Notify model.\\n\\nClause\\xa08.3.3.2.3.4 illustrates the service provisioning update\\nprocedure.\\n\\nClause\\xa08.3.3.2.3.5 illustrates the service provisioning unsubscribe\\nprocedure.\\n\\n8.3.3.2.3.2 Subscribe\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.3.3.2.3.2-1 illustrates the service provisioning subscription\\nprocedure between the EEC and the ECS.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1.

The EEC sends a service provisioning subscription request to the ECS.\\nThe service provisioning subscription request includes the security\\ncredentials of the EEC received during EEC authorization procedure and\\nNotification Target Address (e.g. URL) and may include the UE identifier\\nsuch as GPSI, connectivity information, proposed expiration time and AC\\nProfile information. EEC may provide its desired ECSP identifier(s) in\\nthe service provisioning request based on EEC preference.\\n\\nIf the application triggering is supported and required by the EEC, the\\nEEC may include the EEC Triggering Request information element instead\\nof the Notification Target Address in the request message.\\n\\n2. Upon receiving the request, the ECS performs an authorization check\\nto verify whether the EEC has authorization to perform the operation. If\\nrequired, the ECS may utilize the capabilities (e.g. UE location or user\\nplane management event notification service if available) of the 3GPP\\ncore network as specified in clause\\xa08.10.2. If the request is\\nauthorized, the ECS creates and stores the subscription for\\nprovisioning.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa03: The ECS can monitor the user plane path change for EDGE-1\\ntraffic toward EES(s) by utilizing the user plane management event\\nnotification service specified in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2]. Based on target\\nDNAI reported from 5GC the ECS can notify more suitable EES(s) to the\\nEEC.\\n\\n3. If the processing of the request was successful, the ECS responds\\nwith a service provisioning subscription response, which includes the\\nsubscription identifier and may include the expiration time, indicating\\nwhen the subscription will automatically expire. To maintain the\\nsubscription, the EEC shall send a Service provisioning subscription\\nupdate request prior to the expiration time. If a Service provisioning\\nsubscription update request is not received prior to the expiration\\ntime, the ECS shall treat the EEC as implicitly unsubscribed.\\n\\nIf the ECS is unable to determine the EES information using the inputs\\nin service provisioning subscription request, UE-specific service\\ninformation at the ECS or the ECSP policy, the ECS shall reject the\\nservice provisioning subscription request and respond with an\\nappropriate failure cause.\\n\\nNOTE 4: If the service provisioning subscription request fails, the EEC\\ncan resend the service provisioning subscription request again, taking\\ninto account the received failure cause.\\n\\n8.3.3.2.3.3 Notify\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.3.3.2.3.3-1 illustrates the service provisioning notification\\nprocedure between the EEC and the ECS.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EEC has subscribed with the ECS for the provisioning information\\nas specified in clause\\xa08.3.3.2.3.2.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.3.3.2.3.3-1: Service provisioning notification\\n\\n1. An event occurs at the ECS that satisfies trigger conditions for\\nupdating service provisioning of a subscribed EEC. If UE\\'s location\\ninformation is not available, the ECS may obtain the UE location by\\nutilizing the capabilities of the 3GPP core network as specified in\\nclause\\xa08.10.2. If the UE serving PLMN identifier is not provided by the\\nEEC in the connectivity information of the service provisioning request,\\nthe ECS may invoke the NEF monitoring event API as described in 3GPP TS\\n29.522 [4] and 3GPP TS 29.122 [5] to obtain the UE roaming status and\\nserving PLMN identifier. If the UE is roaming, the ECS may use the\\nserving PLMN identifier to determine the partner ECS information to be\\nprovided to the EEC in the service provisioning notification. If AC\\nprofile(s) were provided by the EEC during subscription creation, the\\nECS identifies the EES(s) based on the provided AC profile(s) and the UE\\nlocation. If AC profiles(s) were not provided, then:\\n\\n- if available, the ECS identifies the EES(s) based on the UE-specific\\nservice information at the ECS and the UE location;\\n\\n- ECS identifies the EES(s) by applying the ECSP policy (e.g. based only\\non the UE location);\\n\\nNOTE 1: Details of the UE-specific service information and how it is\\navailable at the ECS is out of scope.\\n\\nNOTE 2: Both steps are evaluated prior to sending a response.\\n\\nIf desired ECSP identifier(s) provided by the EEC, the ECS identifies\\nthe EES(s) to be sent in step 2 based on registered ECSP identifier in\\nEES profile and the desired ECSP identifier(s).\\n\\nNOTE\\xa03: For EEC desired ECSP identifier usage, it is assumed that the\\nECSP providing the EES and PLMN operator are the same organization and\\nan ECSP providing the EES (desired by the EEC) registers its EES in ECS\\nprovided by another ECSP based on service agreement to provide services\\nto EEC.\\n\\nThe ECS also determines other information that needs to be provisioned,\\ne.g. identification of the EDN, EDN service area, EES endpoints.\\n\\nIf ECS does not identify any suitable EES(s) based on EDN configuration\\navailable at the ECS and UE’s location, the ECS determines a partner ECS\\nthat may satisfy the requirements. Based on ECSP policy, the ECS may use\\npreconfigured or OAM configured information about the partner ECSs or\\nECS discovery via ECS-ER as specified in clause\\xa08.17.2.3 or both. If\\nrequired by the ECSP policies, the ECS may use service provisioning\\ninformation retrieval procedure as specified in clause\\xa08.17.2.4 to\\nobtain service provisioning information from the partner ECS.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa04: ECSP policies can restrict sharing partner ECSP\\'s information\\nwith the EEC.\\n\\nWhen the bundle EAS information is provided, then;\\n\\n- If bundle EAS information included EAS bundle identifier, the ECS\\nidentifies all the EES(s) providing the same EAS bundle identifier.\\n\\n- If bundle EAS information includes a list of EASIDs, the ECS\\nidentifies the one or more EES which support all of the EASs within the\\nsame EDN based on the EDN information obtained in the EES profile.\\n\\nIf the application triggering is supported and required by the EEC as\\nindicated in EEC Triggering Request IE of the Service Provisioning\\nSubscription Request, then the ECS performs the EEC triggering service\\nas described in the clause 8.16.1 and skips the step 2.\\n\\n2. The ECS sends a provisioning notification to the EEC. If the ECS has\\nidentified the relevant EES(s) information, the service provisioning\\nnotification includes the list of EDN configuration information\\ndetermined in step 1. If the ECS has determined suitable partner ECS(s),\\nthe service provisioning notification includes a list of ECS\\nconfiguration information and may include information for roaming UEs to\\nestablish PDU session with the ECS as specified in 3GPP TS 23.548 [20].\\nThe ECS may provide associated EES(s) information (one or more EES\\ninformation) in the service provisioning response along with the bundle\\nEAS information.\\n\\nIf the service provisioning notification contains a list of ECS\\nconfiguration information, the EEC may initiate service provisioning\\nprocedure with one or more ECS(s) provided in the notification. If the\\nUE is roaming to a V-PLMN and the ECS configuration information includes\\nV-PLMN ID in the list of Supported PLMN ID(s), the EEC establishes a PDU\\nsession with the V-PLMN to access the ECS in the visited network as\\nspecified in 3GPP TS 23.548 [20].\\n\\nIf the EDN configuration information in the service provisioning\\nnotification includes an LADN DNN as an identifier for the EDN, the EEC\\nconsiders the LADN as the EDN. Therefore, the service area of EDN is the\\nLADN Service Area, which can be discovered using the UE Registration\\nProcedure.\\n\\nIf the ECS provided information regarding the service continuity support\\nof individual EESs, the EEC may take this information into account when\\nselecting an EES for EEC registration, EAS discovery or T-EAS discovery,\\nrespectively.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa05: Even after the EEC establishes a connection to the EES using\\ninformation received in step 2, the EES can issue AF request to\\ninfluence traffic routing from EEC to EES as specified in\\n3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2] clause\\xa05.6.7.\\n\\n8.3.3.2.3.4 Subscription update\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.3.3.2.3.4-1 illustrates the service provisioning subscription\\nupdate procedure between the EEC and the ECS.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EEC has subscribed with the ECS for the provisioning information\\nas specified in clause\\xa08.3.3.2.3.2.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.3.3.2.3.4-1: Service provisioning subscription update\\n\\n1. The EEC sends a service provisioning subscription update request to\\nthe ECS. The service provisioning subscription update request includes\\nthe security credentials of the EEC received during EEC authorization\\nprocedure along with the subscription identifier and may include the UE\\nidentifier such as GPSI, connectivity information, proposed expiration\\ntime for the updated subscription and AC profile(s).\\n\\n2. Upon receiving the request, the ECS performs an authorization check\\nto verify whether the EEC has authorization to perform the operation. If\\nrequired, the ECS may utilize the capabilities (e.g. UE location) of the\\n3GPP core network as specified in clause\\xa08.10.2. If authorized, the ECS\\nupdates the stored subscription for provisioning as requested in step 1.\\n\\n3. The ECS responds with a service provisioning subscription update\\nresponse, which may include the expiration time, indicating when the\\nupdated subscription will automatically expire. To maintain the\\nsubscription, the EEC shall send a Service provisioning subscription\\nupdate request prior to the expiration time. If a Service provisioning\\nsubscription update request is not received prior to the expiration\\ntime, the ECS shall treat the EEC as implicitly unsubscribed.\\n\\n8.3.3.2.3.5 Unsubscribe\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.3.3.2.3.5-1 illustrates the service provisioning unsubscribe\\nprocedure between the EEC and the ECS.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1.

Upon receiving the request, the ECS performs an authorization check\\nto verify whether the EEC has authorization to perform the operation. If\\nauthorized, the ECS cancels the subscription for provisioning as\\nrequested in step 1.\\n\\n3.

deployment to deliver\\ninformation to other entities.\\n\\nThe following registrations are supported:\\n\\n- EEC registration with EES;\\n\\n- EAS registration with EES; and\\n\\n- EES registration with ECS.\\n\\n8.4.2 EEC Registration\\n\\n8.4.2.1 General \\n\\nAn EEC performs registration with an EES in order to provide information\\nthat can be used by the EES in Edge Computing services. The procedure\\nalso enables initialization, update and removal of the EEC context\\ninformation at the EES. The context may be further used for\\nedge-specific operations or processing, e.g. analytics.\\n\\nAn EEC may be registered with one or more EESs on behalf of one or more\\nACs simultaneously.\\n\\nIn deployments with bundled EAS(s) registered to different EESs, to\\nperform EEC registration (if needed) the EEC sends the EEC registration\\nmessage to all the associated EES for the EAS bundle.\\n\\n8.4.2.2 Procedures\\n\\n8.4.2.2.1 General\\n\\nFollowing are supported for EEC registration:\\n\\n- EEC registration procedure;\\n\\n- EEC registration update procedure;\\n\\n- EEC de-registration procedure; and\\n\\n- EEC Context relocation procedure.\\n\\nNOTE: In this version of specification, each registration procedure\\nprovides for registering a single EEC per UE.\\n\\n8.4.2.2.2 EEC registration\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.4.2.2.2-1 illustrates EEC registration procedure.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EEC is authorized to access the EES for the purpose of performing\\nregistration and has received relevant security credentials as specified\\nin clause\\xa08.11; and\\n\\n2. The EEC has received service provisioning information from the ECS,\\nincluding information for accessing the EES.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.4.2.2.2-1: EEC registration procedure\\n\\n1. The EEC sends EEC registration request to the EES. The request from\\nthe client includes the security credentials received after successful\\nauthorization for edge computing services and may include a proposed\\nexpiration time. The request also optionally includes information\\nindicating to the EES how the EEC expects to use the services of the\\nEES. The EEC may include indication for UE mobility support requirement\\nto the EES.\\n\\nIf the EEC is moving to this EES from the purview of another EES, called\\nS-EES, the request from the EEC may include the identity and endpoint of\\nthe S-EES and an EEC context ID that was provided by the S-EES to\\nmaintain continuity of the EEC context and to authorize EEC context\\nrelocation. If the EEC registration is being performed as part of ACR,\\nthe EEC shall not include the S-EES endpoint and the EEC context ID.\\n\\n2. Upon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES validates the\\nregistration request and verifies the security credentials. The EES\\nfurther determines whether the requirements that were indicated in the\\nAC Profile(s) can be fulfilled e.g., without failing to meet the\\nrequirements of the already registered EECs, and reserves corresponding\\nresources (e.g., for EASs). If the AC Profile(s) include EAS bundle\\ninformation the reserved EAS resources are apportioned among the EASs in\\nthe bundle, based on the indicated requirements and local policies.\\n\\n  NOTE\\xa01: Resource reservation at EEC registration ensures that the EES\\n  provides services for the duration of the registration.\\n\\n  If the EEC provides in the registration request the EAS selection\\n  request indicator and based on EES local policies, the EES selects\\n  EASs providing the capabilities required by the AC Profile(s),\\n  reserves the corresponding resources, and provides the information to\\n  the EEC in the registration response.\\n\\n  If bundle EAS information (either as EAS bundle identifier or as a\\n  list of EASIDs) is included and the EAS selection request indicator is\\n  set, then the EES determines whether all or a subset of the EAS(s) in\\n  the bundle are registered and instantiated. If only a subset of bundle\\n  EASs is found, the EES may determine whether instantiable but not yet\\n  instantiated EASs match the subset of remaining (i.e. not yet found)\\n  bundle EASs and performs the dynamic EAS instantiation triggering\\n  procedure in clause 8.12 for this subset.\\n\\n  If the EEC provides in the registration request a UE type, the EES may\\n  use this information to apply UE-type-specific local policies.\\n\\n  NOTE 2: Without any indication from UE (either EAS selection request\\n  indication or UE type), the EES handling is as per R17 procedure.\\n\\n  NOTE 3: The \"UE type\" IE as present in EEC registration request\\n  message can be used by EES to identify \"constrained device\".\\n\\n3. Upon successful validation of the request, if the received EEC\\nregistration request contains an EEC context ID and a S-EES Endpoint,\\nthe EES performs an EEC Context Pull relocation (clause\\xa08.9.2.2) from\\nthe S-EES. The source and target EES perform EEC Context handling as\\ndetailed in clause\\xa08.9.1.\\n\\n  NOTE\\xa04: Only a single EEC Context ID may be provided in the EEC\\n  registration request.\\n\\n  NOTE\\xa05: In this version of specification, each registration procedure\\n  relocates a single EEC context.\\n\\n  NOTE\\xa06: Step 3 is executed when EEC determines to change its\\n  connection from S-EES to T-EES and ACR is not required.\\n\\nIf the EEC registration request fails after the EEC Context Pull\\nrelocation, e.g., the EES cannot reserve the necessary resources while\\nmeeting the capability requirements of the existing registered EECs, the\\nEES shall determine the EEC Context information stale and send a failure\\nresponse with a corresponding cause.\\n\\n4. The EES sends a successful EEC registration response, which includes\\nthe registration ID and may include a newly assigned EEC context ID. If\\nthe EEC registration request contains AC Profile(s), and the EES\\ndetermines that the requirements indicated in the AC profile(s) cannot\\nbe fulfilled for some of the AC profile(s), the EES shall include the\\nlist of ACIDs of such AC Profile(s) and may include appropriate reasons.\\nIf step 3 was executed, the EEC registration response also includes EEC\\ncontext retrieval result. The EEC stores the new EEC context ID and uses\\nit if and when it registers with another EES. The EES may also provide\\nan expiration time to indicate to the EEC when the registration will\\nautomatically expire. To maintain the registration, the EEC shall send a\\nregistration update request prior to the expiration. If a registration\\nupdate request is not received prior to the expiration time, the EES\\nshall treat the EEC as implicitly de-registered.\\n\\nIf the EEC context relocation status indicates that the EEC context\\nrelocation was not successful, then the EEC performs the required EDGE-1\\nsubscriptions at the T-EES.\\n\\n8.4.2.2.3 EEC registration update\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.4.2.2.3-1 illustrates EEC registration update procedure.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. EEC has already registered with the EES.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.4.2.2.3-1: EEC registration update procedure\\n\\n1. The EEC sends EEC registration update request to the EES. The request\\nfrom the client includes the security credentials received after\\nsuccessful authorization for edge computing services and may include a\\nproposed expiration time and AC profile(s) parameters, including new or\\nupdated selected EAS information. The EEC may include indication for UE\\nmobility support requirement to the EES.\\n\\n2. Upon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES validates the\\nregistration update request and verifies the security credentials.\\n\\n3. Upon successful validation of the request, the EES sends a successful\\nregistration update response, which may include updated expiration time\\nto indicate to the EEC when the updated registration will automatically\\nexpire. If the EEC registration update request contains AC Profile(s),\\nand the EES determines that the requirements indicated in the AC\\nprofile(s) cannot be fulfilled for some of the AC profile(s), the EES\\nshall include the list of ACIDs of such AC Profile(s) and may include\\nappropriate reasons. To maintain the registration, the EEC shall send a\\nregistration update request prior to the expiration time. If a\\nregistration update request is not received prior to the expiration\\ntime, the EES shall treat the EEC as implicitly de-registered.\\n\\n8.4.2.2.4 EEC de-registration\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.4.2.2.4-1 illustrates EEC de-registration procedure.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. EEC has already registered with the EES.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.4.2.2.4-1: EEC de-registration procedure\\n\\n1. The EEC sends EEC de-registration request to the EES. The request\\nfrom the client includes the security credentials received after\\nsuccessful authorization for edge computing services.\\n\\n2. Upon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES validates the\\nde-registration request and verifies the security credentials.\\n\\n3. Upon successful authorization, the EES sends a successful\\nde-registration response.\\n\\n8.4.2.3 Information flows\\n\\n8.4.2.3.1 General\\n\\nThe following information flows are specified for EEC registration:\\n\\n- EEC registration request and response;\\n\\n- EEC registration update request and response; and\\n\\n- EEC registration de-registration request and response.\\n\\n8.4.2.3.2 EEC registration request\\n\\nTable\\xa08.4.2.3.2-1 describes information elements in the EEC registration\\nrequest from the EEC to the EES.\\n\\nTable\\xa08.4.2.3.2-1: EEC registration request\\n\\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  Information element                                                                     Status   Description\\n  EECID                                                                                   M        Unique identifier of the EEC.\\n  UE Identifier                                                                           O        The identifier of the hosting UE (i.e. GPSI or identity token)\\n  Security credentials                                                                    M        Security credentials resulting from a successful authorization for the edge computing service.\\n  AC Profile(s)                                                                           O        Profiles of ACs for which the EEC provides edge enabling services.

General \\n\\nThe EAS Registration procedure allows an EAS to provide its information\\nto an EES in order to enable its discovery.\\n\\nIf there is a change in the requirements or the information of an EAS,\\nit uses the EAS registration update procedure to update the EES.\\n\\nThe EAS uses the EAS de-registration procedure to remove its information\\nfrom the EES.\\n\\nEAS registration at the EES can be time bound. So, to maintain the\\nregistration, the EAS needs to send a registration update request prior\\nto the registration expiration time. If a registration update request is\\nnot received prior to the registration expiration time, the EES treats\\nthe EAS as implicitly de-registered.\\n\\nNOTE: For registered EAS(s), the EES can request AF traffic influence\\nfor any UE, which is implementation specific.\\n\\n8.4.3.2 Procedures\\n\\n8.4.3.2.1 General\\n\\nFollowing are supported for EAS registration:\\n\\n- EAS registration procedure;\\n\\n- EAS registration update procedure; and\\n\\n- EAS de-registration procedure.\\n\\n8.4.3.2.2 EAS registration\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EAS has been configured with an EASID;\\n\\n2. The EAS has been configured with the address (e.g. URI) of the EES;\\nand\\n\\n3. Both the EAS and EES have the necessary credentials to enable\\ncommunications.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.4.3.2.2-1: EAS Registration procedure\\n\\n1. The EAS determines that registration to the EES is needed (e.g. the\\nEAS is instantiated and started up).\\n\\n2. The EAS sends an EAS registration request to the EES. The request\\nshall include the EAS profile and may include proposed expiration time\\nfor the registration.\\n\\n3. The EES performs an authorization check to verify whether the EAS has\\nthe authorization to register on the EES.\\n\\n4. Upon successful authorization, the EES stores the EAS Profile for\\nlater use (e.g. for serving EAS discovery requests received from EECs,\\netc.) and replies to the EAS with an EAS registration response. If the\\nrequest includes bundle ID, the EES stores the received information. The\\nEES may provide an expiration time to indicate to the EAS when the\\nregistration will automatically expire. To maintain the registration,\\nthe EAS shall send a registration update request prior to the expiration\\ntime. If a registration update request is not received prior to the\\nexpiration time, the EES shall treat the EAS as implicitly\\nde-registered.\\n\\n8.4.3.2.3 EAS registration update\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EAS has already registered with the EES.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.4.3.2.3-1: EAS registration update procedure\\n\\n1. The EAS determines that its existing registration needs to be updated\\n(e.g. because the EAS\\'s status or availability schedule has changed, or\\nEAS\\'s registration is about to expire).\\n\\n2. The EAS sends an EAS registration update request to the EES. The\\nrequest shall include the registration ID and may include the EAS\\nprofile and proposed expiration time for the updated registration.\\n\\n3. The EES performs an authorization check to verify whether the EAS has\\nthe authorization to update the registration on the EES.\\n\\n4. Upon successful authorization, the EES updates the registered EAS\\nProfile and replies to the EAS with an EAS registration update response.\\nIf the request includes updated bundle ID, the EES updates the stored\\ninformation. The EES may provide an updated expiration time to indicate\\nto the EAS when the updated registration will automatically expire. To\\nmaintain the registration, the EAS shall send a registration update\\nrequest prior to the expiration time. If a registration update request\\nis not received prior to the expiration time, the EES shall treat the\\nEAS as implicitly de-registered.\\n\\n8.4.3.2.4 EAS de-registration\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EAS has already registered with the EES.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.4.3.2.4-1: EAS de-registration procedure\\n\\n1. The EAS determines that its existing registration needs to be\\nterminated (e.g. because the services of the EAS are not needed\\nanymore).\\n\\n2. The EAS sends an EAS de-registration request to the EES. The request\\nshall include the registration ID.\\n\\n3. The EES performs an authorization check to verify whether the EAS has\\nthe authorization to de-register explicitly.\\n\\n4. Upon successful authorization, the EES removes the registered EAS\\nProfile and replies to the EAS with an EAS de-registration response.\\n\\n8.4.3.3 Information flows\\n\\n8.4.3.3.1 General\\n\\nThe following information flows are specified for EAS registration:\\n\\n- EAS registration request and response;\\n\\n- EAS registration update request and response; and\\n\\n- EAS registration de-registration request and response.\\n\\n8.4.3.3.2 EAS registration request\\n\\nTable\\xa08.4.3.3.1-2 describes information elements in the EAS registration\\nrequest from the EAS to the EES.\\n\\nTable\\xa08.4.3.3.2-1: EAS registration request\\n\\n  -------------------------- -------- -----------------------------------------------\\n  Information element        Status   Description\\n  EAS Profile                M        EAS Profile as described in Table\\xa08.2.4-1\\n  Security credentials       M        Security credentials of the EAS.\\n  Proposed expiration time   O        Proposed expiration time for the registration\\n  -------------------------- -------- -----------------------------------------------\\n\\n8.4.3.3.3 EAS registration response\\n\\nTable\\xa08.4.3.3.3-1 describes information elements in the EAS registration\\nresponse from the EES to the EAS.\\n\\nTable\\xa08.4.3.3.3-1: EAS registration response\\n\\n+---------------------+--------+-------------------------------------+\\n| Information element | Status | Description                         |\\n+---------------------+--------+-------------------------------------+\\n| Successful response | O      | Indicates that the registration     |\\n|                     |        | request was successful.             |\\n+---------------------+--------+-------------------------------------+\\n| > Registration ID   | M      | Identifier of the registration.     |\\n+---------------------+--------+-------------------------------------+\\n| > Expiration time   | O      | Indicates the expiration time of    |\\n|                     |        | the registration.

The discovery of the\\nEASs is based on matching EAS discovery filters provided in the request.\\n\\nWhen multiple EASs are discovered for a specific AC, the EEC may select\\none or more EASs to enable AC communication with one of the selected\\nEASs. The selection algorithm is outside the scope of this\\nspecification. Once the EAS is selected, the EEC may subscribe for the\\nACR event notifications at the EES of the selected EAS, as described in\\nclause\\xa08.8.3.5.2. The EDN configuration information received from ECS\\nmay be used for establishing a connection to EAS(s).\\n\\nEAS discovery may be initiated by the EEC when a certain trigger\\ncondition at the UE is met. Some examples are as follows:\\n\\n- AC related updates available at the EEC (e.g. due to AC\\ninstallation/re-installation/activation), AC requesting application\\nserver access;\\n\\n- Lifetime received via EAS discovery response specified in clause 8.5.3\\nis expired; or\\n\\n- EEC detects the need of application context relocation as in clause\\n8.8.\\n\\nNOTE: When the EEC decides to perform EAS discovery is up to EEC\\nimplementation.\\n\\nIf the EASs consisting of the EAS bundle register to different EESs and\\nif the Bundle Type of the EAS bundle is set to Direct bundle, then the\\nEEC sends the EAS discovery request message to the associated EES for\\nthe bundle EAS information.\\n\\n8.5.2 Procedures\\n\\n8.5.2.1 General\\n\\nFollowing procedures are supported for EAS discovery:\\n\\n- Request-response procedure;\\n\\n- Subscribe-notify procedures for EAS discovery and EAS dynamic\\ninformation subscription, comprising:\\n\\n- Subscription procedure;\\n\\n- Subscription update procedure; and\\n\\n- Unsubscribe procedure;\\n\\n8.5.2.2 Request-response model\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EEC has received information (e.g. URI, IP address) related to\\nthe EES;\\n\\n2. The EEC has received appropriate security credentials authorizing it\\nto communicate with the EES as specified in clause\\xa08.11; and\\n\\n3. The EES is configured with ECSP\\'s policy for EAS discovery.\\n\\nNOTE 1: Details of ECSP\\'s policy are out of scope.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.5.2.2-1: EAS Discovery procedure\\n\\n1. The EEC sends an EAS discovery request to the EES. The EAS discovery\\nrequest includes the requestor identifier [EECID] along with the\\nsecurity credentials and may include EAS discovery filters, EEC service\\ncontinuity support, and may also include UE location to retrieve\\ninformation about particular EAS(s) or a category of EASs, e.g. gaming\\napplications, or Edge Applications Server(s) available in certain\\nservice areas, e.g. available on a UE\\'s predicted or expected route. The\\nrequest may include an EAS selection request indicator.\\n\\n2. Upon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES checks if the EEC is\\nauthorized to discover the requested EAS(s). The authorization check may\\napply to an individual EAS, a category of EASs or to the EDN, i.e. to\\nall the EASs. If UE\\'s location information is not already available, the\\nEES obtains the UE location by utilizing the capabilities of the 3GPP\\ncore network as specified in clause\\xa08.10.3. If EAS discovery filters are\\nprovided by the EEC, but it does not contain Application group profile,\\nthe EES identifies the EAS(s) based on the provided EAS discovery\\nfilters and the UE location.\\n\\nWhen the bundle EAS information is provided, then;\\n\\n- If bundle EAS information includes EAS bundle identifier, the EES\\nidentifies all or part of the EAS(s) associated with the same EAS bundle\\nidentifier.\\n\\n- If bundle EAS information includes a list of EASIDs, the EES\\nidentifies the EASs which are all or part of the EAS bundle.\\n\\nIf the EEC indicates that service continuity support is required, when\\nidentifying the EAS, the EES shall take the indication which ACR\\nscenarios are supported by the AC, the EEC, the EES and the EAS and\\nwhich of these are preferred by the AC into consideration. The EES may\\nselect one EAS and determine whether to perform application traffic\\ninfluence for this AC based on AC\\'s service KPI or EAS’s service KPI in\\ndesired response time, when the EAS does not perform traffic influence\\nin advance.\\n\\nWhen EAS discovery filters are not provided, then:\\n\\n- if available, the EES identifies the EAS(s) based on the UE-specific\\nservice information at the EES and the UE location;\\n\\n- EES identifies the EAS(s) by applying the ECSP policy (e.g. based only\\non the UE location);\\n\\nWhen EAS discovery filters contain Application group profile, the EES\\nchecks whether information about common EAS and related Application\\nGroup ID is available or not. If the common EAS information related to\\nthe Application Group ID is:\\n\\n- not available, then based on the policy if EES needs to select the\\ncommon EAS, the EES identifies an EAS for the Application Group ID based\\non the provided EAS discovery filters such as KPIs, UE-specific service\\ninformation or the ECSP policy. Furthermore, the EES stores the common\\nEAS information and related Application Group ID.\\n\\n- available at the EES, then the EES provides information of that EAS as\\nresult for EAS discovery.\\n\\n  NOTE 2: The EES may have previously determined and stored the common\\n  EAS for Application group ID, or the EES may have received the common\\n  EAS selection information for Application group ID during the common\\n  EAS announcement procedure.\\n\\nWhen the ECS-ER is not available and the EES selects the common EAS, the\\nselected common EAS shall be announced to other EES(s) as per procedure\\nspecified in clause 8.19.\\n\\nWhen the ECS-ER is available and common EAS information corresponding to\\nthe Application Group ID is not available, then the EES identifies one\\nEAS for the group and interacts with the ECS-ER to store the common EAS\\ninformation as described in clause 8.20.2.3. If common EAS information\\nis already available corresponding to the Application Group ID in the\\nrepository, then the ECS-ER returns the common EAS information to the\\nEES as described in clause 8.20.2.3.\\n\\nNOTE 3: Details of the UE-specific service information and how it is\\navailable at the EES is out of scope.\\n\\nNOTE 4: Both steps are evaluated prior to sending a response.\\n\\nUpon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES may also collect edge\\nload analytics from ADAES (as specified in clause 8.8.2 of\\nTS\\xa023.436\\xa0[28]) or performance data from OAM to find whether the EAS(s)\\nsatisfies the Expected AC service KPIs or the Minimum required AC\\nService KPIs.\\n\\nUpon receiving the request from the EEC, if the EEC does not indicate\\nEAS Instantiation Triggering Suppress in the EAS Discovery request, the\\nEES may trigger the ECSP management system to instantiate the EAS that\\nmatches with EAS discovery filter IEs (e.g. ACID) as in clause\\xa08.12.\\n\\nOtherwise, upon receiving the request from the EEC, if the EEC indicates\\nEAS Instantiation Triggering Suppress in the EAS Discovery request and\\nthe EES supports such capability, the EES determines not triggering the\\nECSP management system to instantiate the EAS and may determine\\nInstantiable EAS Information for EAS(s) that are instantiable but not\\nyet instantiated and match the EAS discovery filter IEs. Instantiable\\nEAS Information is provided in the EAS Discovery response and includes\\nthe EASID(s) and, for each EASID, the status indicating whether the EAS\\nis instantiated or instantiable but not yet instantiated.\\n\\nIf the EEC provides in the EAS discovery request the EAS selection\\nrequest indicator, the EES selects EAS satisfying the EAS discovery\\nfilter or based on other information (e.g. ECSP policy) as described\\nabove (if no EAS discovery filter received), and then provides the\\nselected EAS information to the EEC in the discovered EAS list of EAS\\ndiscovery response.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa05: Without EAS selection request indication, the EES handling is as\\nper R17 procedure.\\n\\n3. If the processing of the request was successful, the EES sends an EAS\\ndiscovery response to the EEC, which includes information about the\\ndiscovered EASs and Instantiable EAS Information. For discovered EASs,\\nthis includes endpoint information. Depending on the EAS discovery\\nfilters received in the EAS discovery request, the response may include\\nadditional information regarding matched capabilities, e.g. service\\npermissions levels, KPIs, AC locations(s) that the EASs can support, ACR\\nscenarios supported by the EAS, etc. The EAS discovery response may\\ncontain a list of EASs and Instantiable EAS Information. This list may\\nbe based on EAS discovery filters containing a Geographical or\\nTopological Service Area, e.g. a route, included in the EAS discovery\\nrequest by the EEC. When the discovered EAS is for a certain application\\ngroup, then the Application Group ID is also included in the response\\nmessage. If the discovered EAS is registered to another EES, then the\\nEES endpoint of the EES where the discovered EAS is registered is also\\nincluded in the response message.\\n\\nWhen the EES determines to trigger the EAS instantiation, then the\\nresponse may indicate that the EAS instantiation is in progress so that\\nthe detailed EAS profile information will be available later. When EEC\\nreceives the EAS instantiation in progress indication, the EEC may send\\nEAS discovery subscription request message or send EAS discovery request\\nmessage later to the EES for obtaining updated EAS information.\\n\\nIf the EES is unable to determine the EAS information using the inputs\\nin the EAS discovery request, UE-specific service information at the EES\\nor the ECSP policy, the EES shall reject the EAS discovery request and\\nrespond with an appropriate failure cause.\\n\\nIf the EEC is not registered with the EES, and ECSP policy requires the\\nEEC to perform EEC registration prior to EAS discovery, the EES shall\\ninclude an appropriate failure cause in the EAS discovery response\\nindicating that EEC registration is required.\\n\\nIf the UE location and predicted/expected UE locations, provided in the\\nEAS discovery request, are outside the Geographical or Topological\\nService Area of an EAS, then the EES shall not include that EAS in the\\ndiscovery response. The discovery response may include EAS(s) that\\ncannot serve the UE at its current location if a predicted/expected UE\\nlocation was provided in the EAS discovery request.\\n\\nUpon receiving the EAS discovery response, if the EEC selects an EAS\\nwhich is instantiated (i.e., an EAS profile was provided), the EEC uses\\nthe endpoint information for routing of the outgoing application data\\ntraffic to EAS(s), as needed, and may provide necessary notifications to\\nthe AC(s). The EEC may use the border or overlap between EAS\\nGeographical Service Areas for service continuity purposes. The EEC may\\ncache the EAS information (e.g. EAS endpoint) for subsequent use and\\navoid the need to repeat step 1. If the Lifetime IE is included in the\\nresponse, the EEC may cache the EAS information only for the duration\\nspecified by the Lifetime IE.\\n\\nUpon receiving the EAS discovery response, if the EEC selects an EAS\\nwhich is instantiable but not yet instantiated (i.e. an EAS profile is\\nnot provided), the EEC sends the EAS information provisioning request\\nindicating the selected EASID as in clause 8.15.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa06: Within the duration specified by the Lifetime IE, the cached EAS\\nProfile can be updated (e.g. according to notifications from the EES for\\nchanges of EAS information due to EAS status change) or the cached EAS\\nProfile can be invalidated due to new EAS information discovery (e.g.\\ndue to UE mobility). The EEC can update or invalidate the cached EAS\\ninformation (e.g. on PDU Session Release or Modification Command).\\n\\nNOTE\\xa07: The AC can cache the EAS information (e.g. EAS endpoint) for\\nsubsequent use. In the case of the cached information needing to be\\nupdated or invalidated, the mechanisms for the EEC to notify the AC is\\nup to implementation and is not specified in the current release of the\\npresent document.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa08: The EEC can use the EAS information provided by the discovery\\nprocedure to perform service continuity planning, for example when\\nultra-low latency ACR is required.\\n\\nIf the EAS discovery request fails, the EEC may resend the EAS discovery\\nrequest, taking into account the received failure cause. If the failure\\ncause indicated that EEC registration is required, the EEC shall perform\\nan EEC registration before resending the EAS discovery request.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa09: As long as a proper EAS (e.g. considering expected AC service\\nKPIs included in EAS discovery request) is discovered and selected by\\nthe EES, EEC of a constraint UE can stop sending EAS discovery to rest\\ncandidate EES(s), and provide the selected EAS information to AC.\\n\\n8.5.2.3 Subscribe-notify model\\n\\n8.5.2.3.1 General\\n\\nClause\\xa08.5.2.3.2 and clause\\xa08.5.2.3.3 together illustrate the EAS\\ndiscovery procedure based on Subscribe/Notify model.\\n\\nClause\\xa08.5.2.3.4 illustrates the EAS discovery update procedure.\\n\\nClause\\xa08.5.2.3.5 illustrates the EAS discovery unsubscribe procedure.\\n\\n8.5.2.3.2 Subscribe\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.5.2.3.2-1 illustrates the EAS discovery subscription procedure\\nbetween the EEC and the EES. This subscription enables EES to inform EEC\\nof various EAS discovery related events of interest to EEC (e.g. EAS\\ndiscovery notification and EAS dynamic information).\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EEC has received information (e.g. URI, IP address) related to\\nthe EES;\\n\\n2. The EEC has received appropriate security credentials authorizing it\\nto communicate with the EES as specified in clause\\xa08.11;\\n\\n3. The EES is configured with ECSP\\'s policy for EAS discovery; and\\n\\n4. The EEC has optionally acquired a Notification Target Address to be\\nused in its subscriptions to notifications.\\n\\nNOTE 1: Details of ECSP\\'s policy are out of scope.\\n\\nNOTE 2: How the EEC acquires the notification target address or a\\nnotification channel URI to receive the notifications is out of scope of\\nthis release. The notification target address can terminate at the EEC\\n(e.g. in an IoT device) if the deployment supports EEC reachability, or\\nit can terminate at a push notification service. Details of the push\\nnotification service are out of scope of this release.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.5.2.3.2-1: EAS discovery subscription\\n\\n1. The EEC sends an EAS discovery subscription request to the EES. The\\nEAS discovery subscription request includes the EECID along with the\\nsecurity credentials, Event ID, and may include EAS discovery filters\\nand EAS dynamic information filters to subscribe to information about\\nparticular EAS(s) or a category of EASs (e.g. gaming applications) or\\ndynamic information about EAS(s).\\n\\nIf the application triggering is supported and required by the EEC, the\\nEEC may include the EEC Triggering request information element instead\\nof the Notification Target Address in the request message.\\n\\n2. Upon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES checks if the EEC is\\nauthorized to subscribe for information of the requested EAS(s). The\\nauthorization check may apply to an individual EAS, a category of EASs\\nor to the EDN, i.e. to all the EASs. The EES may utilize the\\ncapabilities (e.g. UE location) of the 3GPP core network as specified in\\nclause\\xa08.10.3. If the request is authorized, the EES creates and stores\\nthe subscription for EAS discovery.\\n\\n3. If the processing of the request was successful, the EES sends an EAS\\ndiscovery subscription response to the EEC, which includes the\\nsubscription identifier and may include the expiration time, indicating\\nwhen the subscription will automatically expire. To maintain the\\nsubscription, the EEC shall send an EAS discovery subscription update\\nrequest prior to the expiration time. If an EAS discovery subscription\\nupdate request is not received prior to the expiration time, the EES\\nshall treat the EEC as implicitly unsubscribed.\\n\\nIn the case of subscription to an EAS availability change event, if\\nthere is no instantiated EAS that matches the requested EAS discovery\\nfilters and such EAS is instantiable based on the information about\\ninstantiable EASs, the request is treated as successful. If the EEC\\nindicates EAS Instantiation Triggering in the EAS discovery subscription\\nrequest and the EAS instantiation is not in progress for the requested\\nEASID, the EES may trigger dynamic instantiation of the EAS as specified\\nin the clause 8.12; if the EEC indicates EAS Instantiation Triggering\\nSuppress in the EAS discovery subscription request, the EES determines\\nnot triggering the ECSP management system to instantiate the EAS and\\nInstantiable EAS Information (e.g. instantiated, instantiable but not be\\ninstantiated yet) is provided; otherwise, the EES does not trigger the\\nEAS instantiation nor returns the Instantiable EAS Information.\\n\\nIn the case of subscription to an EAS dynamic information change event,\\nif the EES is unable to determine the instantiated EAS information using\\nthe inputs in the EAS discovery subscription request, UE-specific\\nservice information at the EES or the ECSP policy, the EES shall reject\\nthe EAS discovery subscription request and respond with an appropriate\\nfailure cause.\\n\\nIf the EEC is not registered with the EES, and ECSP policy requires the\\nEEC to perform EEC registration prior to EAS discovery, the EES shall\\ninclude an appropriate failure cause in the EAS discovery response\\nindicating that EEC registration is required.\\n\\nIf the EAS discovery subscription request fails, the EEC may resend the\\nEAS discovery subscription request again, taking into account the\\nreceived failure cause. If the failure cause indicated that EEC\\nregistration is required, the EEC shall perform an EEC registration\\nbefore resending the EAS discovery subscription request.\\n\\n8.5.2.3.3 Notify\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.5.2.3.3-1 illustrates the EAS discovery notification procedure\\nbetween the EEC and the EES.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EEC has subscribed with the EES for the EAS discovery information\\nas specified in clause\\xa08.5.2.3.2.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.5.2.3.3-1: EAS discovery notification\\n\\n1. An event occurs at the EES that satisfies trigger conditions for\\nnotifying (e.g. to provide EAS discovery information or EAS dynamic\\ninformation) a subscribed EEC. If UE\\'s location information is not\\nalready available, the EES obtains the UE location by utilizing the\\ncapabilities of the 3GPP core network as specified in clause\\xa08.10.3. If\\nEAS discovery filters were provided by the EEC during subscription\\ncreation, the EES identifies the EAS(s) based on the provided EAS\\ndiscovery filters and the UE location.\\n\\nFor EAS dynamic information change event, the EES, based on local\\npolicy, may use received EAS endpoints from EEC or all registered EAS\\nendpoints to get edge load analytics information from ADAES services\\n(e.g. as specified in clause 8.8 of TS 23.436 [27]) to monitor EAS\\nservice status like EAS status and EAS schedule.\\n\\nWhen the bundle EAS information is provided, then;\\n\\n- If EAS bundle identifier was provided, the EES identifies all or part\\nof the EAS(s) associated with the same EAS bundle identifier.\\n\\n- If a list of EASIDs is provided, the EES identifies the EASs which are\\nall or part of the EAS bundle.\\n\\nIf the EEC indicates that service continuity support is required, the\\nEES shall take the indication which ACR scenarios are supported by the\\nAC and the EEC and which of these are preferred by the AC into\\nconsideration.\\n\\nIf EAS discovery filters were not provided, then:\\n\\n- if available, the EES identifies the EAS(s) based on the UE-specific\\nservice information at the EES and the UE location;\\n\\n- EES identifies the EAS(s) by applying the ECSP policy (e.g. based only\\non the UE location);\\n\\nIf EAS discovery filters contain Application group profile, the EES\\nchecks whether information about common EAS and related Application\\nGroup ID is available or not. If the common EAS information related to\\nthe Application Group ID is available at the EES, then the EES provides\\ninformation of that EAS as result for EAS discovery.\\n\\nNOTE 1: The EES may have previously determined and stored the common EAS\\nfor Application group ID, or the EES may have received the common EAS\\nselection information for Application group ID during the common EAS\\nannouncement procedure.\\n\\nNOTE 2: Details of the UE-specific service information and how it is\\navailable at the EES is out of scope.\\n\\nNOTE 3: Both steps are evaluated prior to sending a response.\\n\\nIf the UE is located outside the Geographical or Topological Service\\nArea of an EAS, then the EES shall not include this EAS in the EAS\\ndiscovery notification.\\n\\nIf the application triggering is supported and required by the EEC as\\nindicated in EEC Triggering Request IE of the EAS Discovery Subscription\\nRequest, then the EES performs the EEC triggering service as described\\nin the clause\\xa08.16.1 and skips the step\\xa02.\\n\\n2. The EES sends an EAS discovery notification to the EEC with the EAS\\ninformation determined in step 1, which includes information about the\\ndiscovered EASs and Instantiable EAS Information. For discovered EASs,\\nthis includes endpoint information. Depending on the event type and EAS\\ndiscovery filters received in the EAS discovery subscription request,\\nthe notification may include additional information regarding matched\\ncapabilities, e.g. service permissions levels, KPIs, AC locations(s)\\nthat the EASs can support, ACR scenarios supported by the EAS, etc. The\\nEAS discovery notification may contain a list of EASs and Instantiable\\nEAS Information. This list may be based on EAS discovery filters\\ncontaining a Geographical or Topological Service Area, e.g. a route,\\nincluded in the EAS discovery subscription request by the EEC. When the\\ndiscovered EAS is for a certain application group, then the Application\\nGroup ID is also included in the notification message. If the discovered\\nEAS is registered to another EES, then the EES endpoint of the EES where\\nthe discovered EAS is registered is also included in the notification\\nmessage.\\n\\nUpon receiving the EAS discovery notification, if the EEC selects an EAS\\nwhich is instantiated (i.e., an EAS profile was provided), the EEC uses\\nthe endpoint information for routing of the outgoing application data\\ntraffic to EAS(s), as needed, and may provide necessary notifications to\\nthe AC(s). The EEC may use the border or overlap between EAS\\nGeographical Service Areas for service continuity purposes. The EEC may\\ncache the EAS information (e.g. EAS endpoint) for subsequent use. If the\\nLifetime IE is included in the notification, the EEC may cache the EAS\\ninformation only for the duration specified by the Lifetime IE.\\n\\nNOTE 4: Within the duration specified by the Lifetime IE, the cached EAS\\nProfile can be updated (e.g. according to notifications from the EES for\\nchanges of EAS information due to EAS status change) or the cached EAS\\nProfile can be invalidated due to new EAS information discovery (e.g.\\ndue to UE mobility). The EEC can update or invalidate the cached EAS\\ninformation (e.g. on PDU Session Release or Modification Command).\\n\\nNOTE 5: The AC can cache the EAS information (e.g. EAS endpoint) for\\nsubsequent use. In the case of the cached information needing to be\\nupdated or invalidated, the mechanisms for the EEC to notify the AC is\\nup to implementation and is not specified in the current release of the\\npresent document.\\n\\nNOTE 6: The EEC can use the EAS information provided by the discovery\\nprocedure to perform service continuity planning, for example when\\nultra-low latency ACR is required.\\n\\nUpon receiving the EAS discovery notification, if the EEC selects an EAS\\nwhich is instantiable but not yet instantiated (i.e. an EAS profile is\\nnot provided), the EEC may send the EAS information provisioning request\\nindicating the selected EASID as in clause 8.15.\\n\\n8.5.2.3.4 Subscription update\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.5.2.3.4-1 illustrates the EAS discovery subscription update\\nprocedure between the EEC and the EES.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EEC has subscribed with the EES for the EAS discovery information\\nas specified in clause\\xa08.5.2.3.2\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.5.2.3.4-1: EAS discovery subscription update\\n\\n1. The EEC sends an EAS discovery subscription update request to the\\nEES. The EAS discovery subscription update request includes the security\\ncredentials and the subscription identifier. It may also include EAS\\ndiscovery filters, EAS dynamic information filters and/or proposed\\nexpiration time for the updated subscription.\\n\\n2. Upon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES checks if the EEC is\\nauthorized to update the subscription information. The EES may utilize\\nthe capabilities (e.g. UE location) of the 3GPP core network as\\nspecified in clause\\xa08.10.3. If the request is authorized, the EES\\nupdates the stored subscription for EAS discovery.\\n\\n3. The EES sends an EAS discovery subscription update response to the\\nEEC, which may include the expiration time, indicating when the updated\\nsubscription will automatically expire. To maintain the subscription,\\nthe EEC shall send an EAS discovery subscription update request prior to\\nthe expiration time. If an EAS discovery subscription update request is\\nnot received prior to the expiration time, the EES shall treat the EEC\\nas implicitly unsubscribed.\\n\\n8.5.2.3.5 Unsubscribe\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.5.2.3.5-1 illustrates the EAS discovery unsubscribe procedure\\nbetween the EEC and the EES.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EEC has subscribed with the EES for notification (e.g. EAS\\ndiscovery information and EAS dynamic information) as specified in\\nclause\\xa08.5.2.3.2\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.5.2.3.5-1: EAS discovery unsubscribe\\n\\n1. The EEC sends an EAS discovery unsubscribe request to the EES. The\\nEAS discovery unsubscribe request includes the security credentials of\\nthe EEC along with the subscription identifier.\\n\\n2. Upon receiving the request, the EES performs an authorization check\\nto verify whether the EEC has authorization to perform the operation. If\\nauthorized, the EES cancels the subscription for provisioning as\\nrequested in step 1.\\n\\n3. The EES responds with an EAS discovery unsubscribe response.\\n\\n8.5.3 Information flows\\n\\n8.5.3.1 General\\n\\nThe following information flows are specified for EAS discovery:\\n\\n- EAS discovery request and response;\\n\\n- EAS discovery subscription, notification, subscription update and\\nunsubscribe; and\\n\\n- EAS dynamic information subscription, notification, subscription\\nupdate and unsubscribe.\\n\\n8.5.3.2 EAS discovery request\\n\\nTable\\xa08.5.3.2-1 describes information elements for the EAS discovery\\nrequest.

The service capability APIs exposed include EES\\ncapabilities and exposed 3GPP Core Network capabilities. The 3GPP Core\\nNetwork capabilities may be exposed from EES to the EAS(s) and also to\\nthe EEC(s).\\n\\nThe 3GPP Core Network capabilities APIs which are enhanced for exposure\\nare also specified in this clause.\\n\\nNOTE: When the ACR occurs, the new EAS can re-subscribe the EES\\ncapability exposure services on the T-EES.\\n\\n8.6.2 UE location API\\n\\n8.6.2.1 General\\n\\nThe EES exposes the UE location API to the EAS in order to support\\ntracking or checking the valid location of the UE. The UE location API\\nexposed by the EES relies on the 3GPP core network capabilities as\\nspecified in clause\\xa08.10.3.\\n\\nThe EAS can request UE location API for one-time reporting to check\\ncurrent UE location and for continuous reporting to track UE\\'s location.\\n\\nThe UE location API supports both request-response for one-time queries\\n(in order to check UE\\'s current location) as well as subscribe-notify\\nmodels for providing UE\\'s location to EAS on a continuous basis and\\nenabling the EAS to track UE\\'s location (as UE location changes).\\n\\n8.6.2.2 Procedures\\n\\n8.6.2.2.1 General\\n\\n8.6.2.2.2 Request-response model\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.2.2.2-1 illustrates the interactions between the EES and the\\nEAS for one-time location report.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EAS is authorized to discover and to use UE location API provided\\nby the EES.\\n\\n2. The EES is authorized to use Nnef Event Exposure API for UE location,\\nbased on service level agreement with MNO.\\n\\n3. UE Identifier between EAS and the EES is authorized for the UE\\nlocation API.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.2.2.2-1: UE location API request-response model\\n\\n1. The EAS sends UE location request to the EES. The UE location request\\nshall include the UE Identifier. It may also include location\\ngranularity to indicate requested format of the location e.g. GPS\\nCoordinates, Cell ID, Tracking Area ID, or civic addresses (e.g.\\nstreets, districts, etc.), which can be understood by the EAS and\\nlocation QoS.\\n\\nNOTE 1: The trigger condition of the UE location API is up to\\napplication service logic, which is out of scope of this specification.\\n\\n2. The EES checks the UE location:\\n\\na. If the UE location request from the EAS includes the location\\ngranularity, the EES considers the location granularity parameter for\\nchecking the location of the UE.\\n\\nb. If the EES has a valid locally cached location of the UE, the EES may\\nuse this cached UE location to respond to the EAS. Otherwise, the EES\\nutilizes the capabilities of the 3GPP core network as specified in\\nclause\\xa08.10.3.\\n\\nc. The EES may modify the format of the UE location to fit to the\\nlocation granularity requested from the EAS in the step 1, if supported.\\nFor example, if the EES receives the UE location in a format of tracking\\narea ID or cell ID, the EES can modify the representation of the\\nlocation information to the GPS Coordinates, or civic addresses (e.g.\\nstreets, districts, etc.) as requested by the EAS.\\n\\nNOTE 2: Format modification mechanism of the UE location to fit the\\nlocation granularity is outside the scope of this specification. Step\\n2.c. can be performed if the EES is deployed by the PLMN operator.\\n\\n3. If successful, the EES responds to the EAS with the location of the\\nUE, and optionally the timestamp of the location.\\n\\n8.6.2.2.3 Subscribe-notify model\\n\\n8.6.2.2.3.1 General\\n\\n8.6.2.2.3.2 Subscribe\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.2.2.3.2-1 illustrates the subscribe operation between the EAS\\nand the EES for continuous UE location reporting.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EAS is authorized to discover and to use UE location API provided\\nby the EES;\\n\\n2. The EES is authorized to use 3GPP network exposure capability (e.g.\\nNnef Event Exposure API) for UE location, based on service level\\nagreement with MNO; and\\n\\n3. UE Identifier or UE Group ID between EAS and the EES is authorized\\nfor the UE location API.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.2.2.3.2-1: UE location API: Subscribe operation\\n\\n1. The EAS sends UE location subscribe request to the EES for tracking a\\nUE\\'s location continuously. The UE location subscribe request shall\\ninclude the UE Identifier or UE Group ID and may include proposed\\nexpiration time. It may also include location granularity to indicate\\nrequested format of the location e.g. GPS Coordinates, Cell ID, Tracking\\nArea ID, or civic addresses (e.g. streets, districts, etc.), which can\\nbe understood by the EAS and location QoS.\\n\\n2. The EES checks if the request from the EAS is authorized. If\\nauthorized, the EES sends success response to the EAS and utilizes the\\nUE location exposure capability of the 3GPP core network as specified in\\nclause\\xa08.10.3. The EES requests continuous location reporting from the\\n3GPP system to have up to date location information of the UE(s).\\n\\n3. The EES may subscribe to UE expected behaviour analytics (UE\\nmobility) as described in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.288\\xa0[18].\\n\\n4. The response includes the subscription identifier and may include the\\nexpiration time, indicating when the subscription will automatically\\nexpire. To maintain the subscription, the EAS shall send a UE location\\nsubscription update request prior to the expiration time. If a UE\\nlocation subscription update request is not received prior to the\\nexpiration time, the EES shall treat the EAS as implicitly unsubscribed.\\nIf it is not authorized, the EES sends failure response with rejection\\ncause.\\n\\n8.6.2.2.3.3 Notify\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.2.2.3.3-1 illustrates the notify operation between the EES\\nand the EAS for continuous location.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EAS has subscribed to UE location API provided by the EES.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.2.2.3.3-1: UE location API: Notify operation\\n\\n1. The EES detects the location of a UE e.g., receiving location of a UE\\nfrom the 3GPP system. The EES may cache the detected location\\ninformation locally with timestamp as the latest location information of\\nthe UE(s) and start the notification aggregation for a group of UEs. The\\nEES decides whether to aggregate and the aggregation period based on the\\nanalytics result received from the 3GPP Core Network, local policy and\\nUE location subscription information received from the EAS. The EES\\ndetermines to notify the location information of the UE(s) to the EAS\\nwhich has subscribed for UE(s)\\'s location.\\n\\n2. The EES sends UE location notification to the EAS. The EES includes\\nthe location of the UE(s). Each UE location includes UE ID and location\\ntype and may include the location accuracy and the timestamp of the\\nlocation.\\n\\nThe EES may modify the format of location information to fit to the\\nlocation granularity requested from the EAS during the subscribe\\noperation, if supported. For example, if the EES receives the UE\\nlocation in a format of tracking area ID or cell ID, the EES can modify\\nthe representation of the location information to the GPS Coordinates,\\nor civic addresses (e.g. streets, districts, etc.) as requested from the\\nEAS.\\n\\n8.6.2.2.3.4 Subscription update\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.2.2.3.4-1 illustrates the subscription update operation\\nbetween the EAS and the EES.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EAS has subscribed to UE location API provided by the EES.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.2.2.3.4-1: UE location API: Subscription update operation\\n\\n1. The EAS sends UE location subscription update request to the EES. The\\nrequest includes the subscription identifier of the subscription to be\\nupdated. The UE location subscription update request may also include\\nproposed expiration time for the updated subscription, updated Location\\ngranularity and Location QoS.\\n\\n2. The EES checks if the request from the EAS is authorized. If\\nauthorized, the EES updates the subscription request and may update the\\nUE location subscription in the 3GPP Core Network.\\n\\n3. The EES may update the subscription to the UE expected behaviour\\nanalytics.\\n\\n4. The EES sends the UE location subscription update response to the\\nEAS.\\n\\n8.6.2.2.3.5 Unsubscribe\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.2.2.3.5-1 illustrates the unsubscribe operation between the\\nEAS and the EES to stop the UE location notifications.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EAS has subscribed to UE location API provided by the EES.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.2.2.3.5-1: UE location API: unsubscribe operation\\n\\n1. The EAS sends the UE location unsubscribe request to the EES.\\n\\n2. The EES checks if the EAS is authorized or not.

EES also uses ACR management event notifications to inform the\\nEAS of the need to start an ACT or cancel a previously started ACT. ACR\\nmanagement event notifications exposed by the EES may rely on the NEF\\nnorthbound API for monitoring event of user plane path management event.\\n\\nThis capability exposed by the EES supports:\\n\\n- \"User plane path change\". This event supports to detect user plane\\npath change for the application traffic and report the corresponding\\nnotification with user plane path change to the EAS.\\n\\n- \"ACR monitoring\". This event supports to detect user plane path change\\nfor the application traffic, discover the T-EAS(s), and report the\\ncorresponding notification with the discovered T-EAS(s).\\n\\n- \"ACR facilitation\". This event supports to detect user plane path\\nchange for the application traffic, make the decision for ACR, discover\\nthe T-EAS(s), influence the traffic for the selected T-EAS and report\\nthe corresponding notification with the selected T-EAS.\\n\\n- \"ACT start/stop\". This event informs the EAS the need to start or stop\\nan ACT towards or from another EAS for a particular UE. The \"ACT start\"\\ncan also inform the EAS of the ACR parameters.\\n\\n- \"ACR Selection\". This event informs the EAS about the selected ACR\\nscenario list for each AC using the EAS.\\n\\nThe availability of the ACR management event notifications relying on\\nthe user plane path management event notification service exposed by 5GC\\nmay change due to UE mobility between 5GC and EPC. If an EES exposes ACR\\nevent notifications to EAS(s) for a UE by relying on the 3GPP Core\\nNetwork northbound API for user plane path management notifications, the\\nEES monitors the availability of the northbound API for UE(s) served by\\nthe EAS (e.g. by utilizing Nnef_APISupportCapability as described in\\n3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.502\\xa0[3]) and provides the availability information to the EAS\\naccordingly. If CAPIF is supported, the EES determines if the ACR\\nmanagement event API is available and able to be exposed to the EAS for\\na UE via the Availability of service APIs event notifications provided\\nby the CAPIF core function as defined in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.222\\xa0[6].\\n\\n8.6.3.2 Procedures\\n\\n8.6.3.2.1 General\\n\\n8.6.3.2.2 Subscribe\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.3.2.2-1 illustrates the subscribe operation between the EAS\\nand the EES for ACR management event notifications.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.3.2.2-1: ACR management event API: Subscribe operation\\n\\n1. The EAS sends ACR management event subscribe request (e.g. tracking\\nthe UE\\'s user plane path change continuously). The EAS shall include UE\\nIdentifier or UE Group ID for \"user plane path change\", \"ACR monitoring\"\\nand \"ACR facilitation\" events.\\n\\na. The EAS may include the \"user plane path change\" event to indicate\\nthe EES to notify the EAS when the EES detects there is a user plane\\npath change for the application traffic and the EAS may include\\nSubscription Type (Early and/or Late notification defined in\\nclause\\xa05.6.7 of 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501 [2]) and/or Indication of EAS\\nAcknowledgement in the event subscription.\\n\\nb. The EAS may include the \"ACR monitoring\" event to indicate the EES to\\nnotify the EAS when the EES detects there is a need for the ACR (e.g.\\nwhen T-EAS is available at the target DNAI). The EAS may also include\\nthe Event Filters to specify the conditions to match for notifying the\\nevent, e.g., inter-EDN mobility, intra-EDN mobility.\\n\\nc. The EAS may include the \"ACR facilitation\" event to request the EES\\nto make the decision for ACR, discover the T-EAS(s), influence the\\ntraffic for the selected T-EAS and notify the S-EAS of the selected\\nT-EAS. If required, the EAS can add an indication to request service\\ncontinuity planning.\\n\\nd. The EAS may include the \"ACT start/stop\" event to indicate the EES to\\nnotify the EAS of the need for start or stop ACT to or from another EAS\\nfor a particular UE. The EES may also use \"ACT start\" event to notify\\nthe EAS of the ACR parameters.\\n\\ne. The EAS may include the “ACR Selection” event to indicate the EES to\\nnotify the EAS of the selected ACR scenario list applicable to ACs using\\nthe EAS.\\n\\n2. The EES checks if the EAS is authorized for this operation.\\n\\nIf authorized, and if the subscription in step 1 includes at least one\\nof the \"user plane path change\", \"ACR monitoring\" and \"ACR facilitation\"\\nevents, the EES may invoke the PFD management procedure with the 3GPP\\nCore Network as described in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.682\\xa0[10] and 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.502\\xa0[8]\\nwith an application id. The traffic filter information sent by the EAS\\nis used in requesting PFD management service. Further the EES provides\\nthe same application id for requesting user plane path management event\\nservice.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa01: PFD management can be optionally supported in MNO. If EES cannot\\ninvoke step 2a, it responds EAS with appropriate error.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa02: The EES can map the EASID into the application id that is used\\nto invoke the PFD management procedure.\\n\\n3. If the subscription in step 1 includes at least one of the \"user\\nplane path change\", \"ACR monitoring\" and \"ACR facilitation\" events, the\\nEES checks if there exists a subscription with the 3GPP core network for\\nthe user plane path management event notifications corresponding to the\\nUE information obtained in step\\xa01 as described in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2] and\\n3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.502\\xa0[3], which may be triggered by other EAS for the same UE.\\nThe EES checks the availability of the user plane path management event\\nservice for the UE(s).\\n\\na. if a subscription with 3GPP core network does not exist, then the EES\\nsubscribes with the 3GPP core network (PCF, NEF or SCEF+NEF) for the\\nuser plane path management event notifications of the UE(s) as described\\nin 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2] and 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.502\\xa0[3] If the EAS provides\\nSubscription Type and/or Indication of EAS Acknowledgement, the EES\\ninclude the type of subscription and/or the indication of \"AF\\nacknowledgement to be expected\" as information on AF subscription to\\ncorresponding SMF events within the AF Request;\\n\\nb. if a subscription with 3GPP core network exists, then the EES uses\\nthe locally cached user plane path management event notification\\ninformation of the UE(s) to respond to the EAS.\\n\\nThe EES stores the subscription related to the EAS.\\n\\n4. If the event is \"user plane path change\", the EES may subscribe to UE\\nexpected behaviour analytics (UE mobility and UE communication) for the\\ngroup of UEs as described in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.288\\xa0[18].\\n\\n5. If EAS is authorized, the EES responds with ACR management event\\nsubscribe response. If EAS is not authorized, the EES provides a\\nrejection response with cause information.\\n\\nIf the target UE(s) and the 3GPP network support mobility between 5GC\\nand EPC, the EES monitors the availability of the user plane path\\nmanagement event notification from the 3GPP network by utilizing\\nNnef_APISupportCapability or Availability of service APIs event\\nnotifications provided by the CAPIF core function.\\n\\n8.6.3.2.3 Notify\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.3.2.3-1 illustrates the notify operation between the EES and\\nthe EAS for continuous ACR management event notifications.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.3.2.3-1: ACR management event API: Notify operation\\n\\n1. The EES detects the ACR management event of a UE (e.g. receiving User\\nplane path management event notification for a UE from the 3GPP core\\nnetwork) , or receiving ACR request from the EEC, or when the selected\\nACR scenario list for a particular AC changes.\\n\\na. If \"user plane path change\" Event is subscribed, the EES may cache\\nthe detected User plane path management event notification locally with\\ntimestamp as the latest information of the UE(s) and start the\\nnotification aggregation for a group of UEs. The EES decides whether to\\naggregate and the aggregation period based on the analytics result\\nreceived from the 3GPP Core Network, local policy and User Plane path\\nmanagement subscription information received from the EAS. The EES\\ndetermines to notify the user plane path management event notification\\ninformation (e.g., DNAI) to the EASs which has subscribed for the \"user\\nplane path management\" event.\\n\\nb. If \"ACR monitoring\" Event is subscribed, based on the detected user\\nplane path change report sent from the 3GPP core network, the EES checks\\nwhether the target DNAI is in the EAS profile of the subscribing EAS, if\\nnot it further checks whether a T-EAS is available at the target DNAI as\\ndescribed in steps 2-4 of clause\\xa08.8.3.2. If a T-EAS is available, the\\nEES notifies the EAS with T-EAS endpoint; otherwise this event\\nnotification will not be sent. Also, when the EES receives the ACR\\nrequest from the EEC, the EES decides to send the notification to the\\nEAS.\\n\\nc. If \"ACR facilitation\" Event is subscribed, based on the detected user\\nplane path change report sent from the 3GPP core network, the EES checks\\nwhether the target DNAI is in the EAS profile of the subscribing EAS, if\\nnot it further checks whether a T-EAS is available at the target DNAI as\\ndescribed in steps 2-4 of clause\\xa08.8.3.2. If a T-EAS is available, the\\nEES selects the T-EAS from the discovered EAS list and applies the AF\\ntraffic influence with the N6 routing information of the selected T-EAS\\nin the 3GPP Core Network. The EES also notifies the S-EAS with the\\nselected T-EAS endpoint.\\n\\nd. If \"ACT start/stop\" event is subscribed, during the ACR launch if the\\nEEC indicates the need to notify the EAS in the ACR request as described\\nin clause 8.8.3.4, the EES shall send notification to the EAS to inform\\nit about the need to start or stop the ACT to or from another EAS. The\\nEES may include a service continuity planning indication so that the EES\\nwill monitor UE location. The notification message includes ACR identity\\n(ACID, UE ID, S-EAS endpoint and T-EAS endpoint).\\n\\ne. If “ACR Selection” event is subscribed, the EES shall send\\nnotification to the EAS to update the selected ACR scenario list\\napplicable for a particular AC (ACID, UE ID) if an update was received\\nas described in clause 8.15.2.2.\\n\\n2. The EES sends ACR management event notification to the EAS. The EES\\nincludes the ACR management event notification information of the UE(s)\\nand optionally the timestamp. If the event triggering the notification\\nis DNAI change, the timestamp can be included to indicate the age of the\\nuser plane path management event notification information. The EES may\\nonly provide part of information included in the user plane path\\nmanagement event notification from 3GPP network (e.g. target DNAI). If\\nthe EAS had provided \"Indication of EAS acknowledgement\", the EES waits\\nfor acknowledgement from the EAS before it sends AF acknowledgement to\\nthe 3GPP core network.\\n\\nIf the event is \"ACT start/stop\", the notification shall include the\\nendpoint address of the other EAS and the UE\\xa0ID. The \"ACT start\"\\nnotification may include ACR parameters as per clause 8.8.3.9. Upon\\nreceiving the notification about the start of the ACR execution with\\n\"ACT start\" event, the S-EAS avoids triggering a second ACR execution\\nfor the same identity (ACID, UE ID, S-EAS endpoint and T-EAS endpoint)\\nuntil the current ACR execution is completed.\\n\\nNOTE: How long the detection entity should wait for current ACT to\\ncomplete in order to start to detect or to decide another ACR is up to\\nthe implementation.\\n\\nIf the event is “ACR Selection”, the notification shall include the\\nselected ACR scenario list, ACID and UE ID. Upon receiving the\\nnotification, the EAS determines if it should perform ACR detection\\nand/or ACR decision for a particular AC (ACID, UE ID).\\n\\n3. If the EAS had included Indication of EAS Acknowledgement within ACR\\nmanagement event subscribe request described in clause\\xa08.6.3.2.1, the\\nEAS sends EAS Acknowledgement as a response to ACR management event\\nnotification to the EES either immediately or after the required ACT is\\ncompleted. The EAS may reply in negative, e.g., the EAS may determine\\nnot to perform ACR. Then, the EES sends the AF acknowledgement to the\\n3GPP core network.\\n\\nIf the EAS had included Indication of EAS acknowledgement for service\\ncontinuity planning within ACR management event subscribe request\\ndescribed in clause 8.6.3.2.1, the EAS sends EAS Acknowledgement as a\\nresponse to ACR management event notification for service continuity\\nplanning of which detailed procedure is described in step 4 of clause\\n8.8.3.9.\\n\\n8.6.3.2.4 Subscription update\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.3.2.4-1 illustrates the subscription update operation between\\nthe EAS and the EES for ACR management event notifications.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.3.2.4-1: ACR management event API: Subscription update\\noperation\\n\\n1. The EAS sends ACR management event subscription update request to\\nupdate an existing subscription. The subscription update request may\\ninclude Event ID, Event Filter, Event Report, Subscription Type (Early\\nand/or Late notification defined in clause\\xa05.6.7 of 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501 [2])\\nand/or Indication of EAS Acknowledgement.\\n\\n2. The EES checks if the EAS is authorized for the operation.\\n\\nIf authorized and if the subscription in step 1 includes only \"ACT\\nstart/stop\" event, the EES stores the updated subscription related to\\nthe EAS and step 3 is skipped.\\n\\nIf authorized, and if the subscription in step 1 includes at least one\\nof the \"user plane path change\", \"ACR monitoring\" and \"ACR facilitation\"\\nevents, the EES checks if there exists a subscription with the 3GPP core\\nnetwork for the user plane path management event notifications\\ncorresponding to the updated information obtained in step\\xa01 as described\\nin 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2] and 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.502\\xa0[3], which may be triggered by\\nother EAS for the same UE.\\n\\na. if a subscription with 3GPP core network does not exist corresponding\\nto the updated information, then the EES subscribes with the 3GPP core\\nnetwork (PCF, NEF or SCEF+NEF) for the user plane path management event\\nnotifications of the UE(s) as described in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2] and\\n3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.502\\xa0[3] If the EAS provides Subscription Type and/or\\nIndication of EAS Acknowledgement, the EES includes the type of\\nsubscription and/or the indication of \"AF acknowledgement to be\\nexpected\" as information on AF subscription to corresponding SMF events\\nwithin the AF Request;\\n\\nb. if a subscription with 3GPP core network exists corresponding to the\\nupdated information, then the EES uses the locally cached user plane\\npath management event notification information of the UE(s) to respond\\nto the EAS.\\n\\nThe EES stores the updated subscription related to the EAS.\\n\\n3. The EES may update the subscription to the UE expected behaviour\\nanalytics.\\n\\n4. The EES responds with ACR management event subscription response.\\n\\n8.6.3.2.5 Unsubscribe\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.3.2.5-1 illustrates the unsubscribe operation between the EAS\\nand the EES for ACR management event notifications.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.3.2.5-1: ACR management event API: Unsubscribe operation\\n\\n1. The EAS sends ACR management event unsubscribe request to the EES to\\ncancel the ACR management event subscription.\\n\\n2. The EES checks if another EAS requires to track the UE\\'s user plane\\npath change or not. If not, the EES unsubscribes the user plane path\\nmanagement event notifications from the 3GPP core network for the\\ncorresponding UE.\\n\\n3. The EES unsubscribes from the UE expected behaviour analytics, if\\napplicable.\\n\\n4. The EES checks if the EAS is authorized for the operation. If\\nauthorized, the EES removes the subscription related to the EAS and\\nsends ACR management event unsubscribe response to the EAS.\\n\\n8.6.3.3 Information flows\\n\\n8.6.3.3.1 General\\n\\nThe following information flows are specified for ACR management event\\nAPI:\\n\\n- ACR management event subscription, notification, subscription update\\nand unsubscribe.\\n\\n8.6.3.3.2 ACR management event subscribe request\\n\\nTable\\xa08.6.3.3.2-1 describes the information elements for an ACR\\nmanagement event subscribe request from the EAS to the EES.\\n\\nTable\\xa08.6.3.3.2-1: ACR management event subscribe request\\n\\n+-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+\\n| Information element         | Status | Description                 |\\n+-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+\\n| EASID                       | M      | The identifier of the EAS   |\\n+-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+\\n| Security credentials        | M      | Security credentials of the |\\n|                             |        | EAS                         |\\n+-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+\\n| UE ID (NOTE\\xa01)              | O      | The identifier of the UE    |\\n|                             |        | (i.e. GPSI or identity      |\\n|                             |        | token)                      |\\n+-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+\\n| UE Group ID (NOTE\\xa01)        | O      | Identifies a group of UEs   |\\n|                             |        | as defined in clause\\xa07.2.7  |\\n+-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+\\n| Event ID(s)                 | M      | Event ID:                   |\\n|                             |        |                             |\\n|                             |        | -

exposure API\\n\\n8.6.4.1 General\\n\\nAC information exposure enables EASs to obtain information about\\ncapabilities of ACs from the EESs. This information may facilitate\\ncommunications between EASs and ACs, e.g. push notifications. The\\ninformation shared is subject to access control as well as privacy and\\nsecurity mechanisms.\\n\\n8.6.4.2 Procedures \\n\\n8.6.4.2.1 General\\n\\n8.6.4.2.2 Subscribe\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.4.2.2-1 illustrates the AC information subscription procedure\\nbetween the EAS and the EES.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EAS is registered with the EES; and\\n\\n2. The AC Profiles of the ACs on the UE are available at the EEC on the\\nUE.\\n\\nFigure 8.6.4.2.2-1: AC information subscription\\n\\n1. The EAS sends an AC information subscription request to the EES. The\\nrequest may contain filters to retrieve information about particular ACs\\ne.g. AC profile parameters or parameter ranges to be matched, specific\\nUE Identifiers, location ranges, etc.\\n\\nNOTE: The trigger conditions of the AC information API (e.g. resource\\nload predictive analytics) are up to service logic, which is out of\\nscope of this specification.\\n\\n2. Upon receiving the request from the EAS, the EES performs an\\nauthorization check to verify whether the EAS has authorization to\\nperform the operation. The EES determines the matching AC information\\ncorresponding to the filter provided and composes a result. The EES\\nstores the subscription information for future processing.\\n\\n3. The EES sends an AC information subscription response to the EAS with\\nthe result composed in step 2.\\n\\n8.6.4.2.3 Notify\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.4.2.3-1 illustrates the AC information notification procedure\\nbetween the EES and the EAS.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EAS subscribed for AC information at the EES.\\n\\nFigure 8.6.4.2.3-1: AC information notification\\n\\n1. The EES is triggered for AC information updates, e.g. it receives an\\nEEC registration request, it determines if it matches the filter\\nprovided by the EAS, e.g. if the AC Geographical Service Area is\\nincluded in the EAS provided Geographical Service Area.\\n\\n2. The EES sends an AC information notification to the EAS.\\n\\n8.6.4.2.4 Subscription update\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.4.2.4-1 illustrates the AC information subscription update\\nprocedure between the EAS and the EES.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EAS has subscribed for AC information as described in\\nclause\\xa08.6.4.2.2.\\n\\nFigure 8.6.4.2.4-1: AC information subscription update\\n\\n1. The EAS sends an AC information subscription update request to the\\nEES. The request may contain updated filters to retrieve information\\nabout particular ACs e.g. AC profile parameters or parameter ranges to\\nbe matched, specific UE Identifiers, location ranges, etc.\\n\\n2. Upon receiving the request from the EAS, the EES performs an\\nauthorization check to verify whether the EAS has authorization to\\nperform the operation. If authorized, the EES updates the stored\\nsubscription information.\\n\\n3. The EES sends an AC information subscription update response to the\\nEAS.\\n\\n8.6.4.2.5 Unsubscribe\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.4.2.5-1 illustrates the AC information unsubscribe procedure\\nbetween the EAS and the EES.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EAS has subscribed for AC information as described in\\nclause\\xa08.6.4.2.2.\\n\\nFigure 8.6.4.2.5-1: AC information unsubscribe\\n\\n1. The EAS sends an AC information unsubscribe request to the EES.\\n\\n2. Upon receiving the request from the EAS, the EES performs an\\nauthorization check to verify whether the EAS has authorization to\\nperform the operation.

API\\n\\n8.6.5.1 General\\n\\nEES exposes UE Identifier API to the EAS and EEC in order to provide an\\nidentifier uniquely identifying a UE. This API is used by an EAS or EEC\\nto obtain the identifier of the UE if the EAS or EEC does not have it\\n(e.g. hasn\\'t already cached). This identifier, called UE ID and defined\\nin clause 7.2.6, is used by the EAS to invoke capability APIs specific\\nto UEs over EDGE-3 and/or EDGE-7 depending on the UE ID type.\\n\\nThe EAS\\'s direct invocation of the UE Identifier API of the EES may\\nresult in UE ID not found response (e.g. if the NATed UE\\'s public IPv4\\naddress can\\'t be resolved by the core network). Under such\\ncircumstances, the EAS may choose to signal its AC to trigger the UE ID\\nquery onto the EEC over EDGE-5 (see clause 8.14.2.6). In turn, the EEC\\nwould invoke the EES\\'s UE Identifier API using the UE\\'s CN assigned IP\\naddresses (i.e. IPv4 and/or IPv6) which should result in return of the\\nUE ID to the EEC and from thereon to the AC and the EAS.\\n\\nNOTE 1: To overcome CN UE\\'s assigned private IP address reuse issue\\n(e.g. UE\\'s private IPv4 reuse by 5GC), the EES would need to be\\npre-configured with the public IP address range (used by the NAT\\nfunction over N6) and its associated IP domain.\\n\\nNOTE 2: EEC retrieval of the UE\\'s IP address from the device is out of\\nscope.\\n\\n8.6.5.2 Procedure\\n\\nFigure 8.6.5.2-1 illustrates the interactions between the EES and the\\nEAS or EEC.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EAS or EEC is authorized to discover and to use UE Identifier API\\nprovided by the EES.\\n\\n2. When the EEC is used to invoke the UE Identifier API with the UE IPv6\\naddress as the input parameter, the UE IPv6 address may or may not be\\nNATed. If NATed however, the IPv6 may not be reused (i.e. assigned to\\nmore than one UE simultaneously). If the EEC already has the UE ID (GPSI\\nas per clause 7.2.6), and it needs the Edge UE ID to share with an\\nAC/EAS, this procedure can still be used to retrieve Edge UE ID.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.5.2-1: UE Identifier API\\n\\n1. The EAS or EEC invokes UE Identifier API exposed by the EES. If it is\\nthe EAS invoking the API and it recognizes that the UE’s IP address is a\\npublic IP address, i.e., the UE is behind a NAT, the Port Number and\\nassociated IP address should be included in user information.\\n\\n2. The EES uses the received user information in the step 1 (e.g. IP\\naddress) and obtains the UE identifier by interacting with NEF as\\nspecified in clause 4.15.10 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]. If it is the EEC\\ninvoking the API with only UE IP address, it shall be interpreted by EES\\nthat EEC is requesting the UE ID for interaction with EES (hence EES\\nshall use its own AF Identifier towards NEF and consequently the UE ID\\nis EES specific). When the EES needs to interact with the NEF\\'s\\nNnef_UEId_Get (see TS 23.502 clause 4.15.10 \"AF specific UE ID\\nretrieval\") as per EAS request, the EES may use either its own AF\\nIdentifier or EASID as AF Identifier instead of its own AF Identifier.\\n\\n3. The EES provides the UE identifier to the EAS or to EEC (i.e.\\nwhichever invoked the API). The UE identifier returned in the response\\nwhich is referred to as UE ID may be the 3GPP Core Network assigned UE\\nID (aka AF-specific UE ID; see TS 23.502 clause 4.15.10) or the\\nEES-generated Edge UE ID as defined in clause 7.2.9. If UE ID (GPSI as\\nper clause 7.2.6) is included in the request received from EEC, the EES\\ncan provide the Edge UE ID based on the received UE ID and step 2 can be\\nskipped. For EEC requesting the UE ID for interaction with EES, the EES\\nreturns its 3GPP Core Network assigned UE ID (aka AF specific UE ID,\\nwhich is a GPSI in the form of an External ID as per clause 7.2.6) to\\nthe EEC.\\n\\nEditor\\'s note: [SA3] Whether and how user\\'s consent is obtained to share\\nthe UE identifier with a particular EAS or EEC is SA3\\'s responsibility.\\n\\n4. The EAS uses the UE ID received in step 3 to invoke capability\\nexposure API(s) provided by the EES over EDGE-3 and/or EDGE-7 depending\\non the UE ID type. The EEC can use the UE ID which is EES specific\\nreceived in step 3 to invoke API(s) provided by the EES over EDGE-1\\nreference point.\\n\\nNOTE: UE ID of type CN-assigned can be used over EDGE-1, EDGE-3 and\\nEDGE-7 whereas the UE ID of type EES-generated Edge UE ID can be used\\nover EDGE-3 only.\\n\\n8.6.5.3 Information flows\\n\\n8.6.5.3.1 General\\n\\nThe following information flows are specified for UE Identifier API:\\n\\n- UE Identifier request and response.\\n\\n8.6.5.3.2 UE Identifier API request\\n\\nTable\\xa08.6.5.3.2-1: UE Identifier API request\\n\\n+-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+\\n| Information element         | Status | Description                 |\\n+=============================+========+=============================+\\n| User information (NOTE\\xa01)   | O      | Information about the User  |\\n| (NOTE\\xa03)                    |        | or UE available in the EAS  |\\n|                             |        | or EEC, e.g. IP address.    |\\n+-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+\\n| UE ID                       | O      | UE ID in the form of GPSI   |\\n|                             |        | as per clause 7.2.6.        |\\n| (NOTE\\xa02) (NOTE\\xa03)           |        |                             |\\n+-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+\\n| EAS ID list                 | O      | Identifier of the EAS(s)    |\\n|                             |        | for which the UE IDs are    |\\n| (NOTE\\xa04)                    |        | requested for by EAS or EEC |\\n|                             |        | given the User information  |\\n|                             |        | (e.g. IP address).          |\\n+-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+\\n| EAS Provider ID             | O      | Identifier of the ASP that  |\\n|                             |        | provides the EAS.           |\\n+-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+\\n| Application Port ID         | O      | Application Port ID, as     |\\n|                             |        | defined in 3GPP TS 23.502   |\\n| (NOTE\\xa05)                    |        | [3], associated with the    |\\n|                             |        | EAS.                        |\\n+-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+\\n| Security Credentials        | M      | Security credentials of the |\\n|                             |        | EAS or EEC.                 |\\n+-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+\\n| NOTE\\xa01: This IE is          |        |                             |\\n| Mandatory when EAS invoke   |        |                             |\\n| the UE ID API.

and EAS with a specific QoS and\\nthe modification of the QoS of this data session.\\n\\nThe Session with QoS API exposed by the EES relies on the northbound\\nPolicy Authorization Service API exposed by the PCF as specified in\\n3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.502\\xa0[3] and 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.503\\xa0[12], if the EES is connected to\\nthe PCF via the N5 reference point, or on the northbound AF Session with\\nQoS Service API exposed by the NEF as specified in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.502\\xa0[3]\\nand 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.503\\xa0[12], if the EES is connected to the PCF via an NEF.\\n\\nThis API supports to apply the required QoS for both ongoing session and\\nfuture session for a UE or a group of UEs.\\n\\nThe level of support of the Session with QoS API may change due to UE\\nmobility between 5GC and EPC. E.g. QoS monitoring is only applicable in\\n5GC. If an EES exposes the Session with QoS API to EAS(s) for a UE, the\\nEES monitors such changes and provides the available information to the\\nEAS.\\n\\nAlternatively to using the API described in the following clauses, the\\nEAS may also act as an AF and directly access the 3GPP Core Network\\ncapabilities to request an AF session with QoS (see clause\\xa08.7.2). For\\nany data session between AC and EAS, the EAS shall use only one of these\\nalternatives.\\n\\n8.6.6.2 Procedures\\n\\n8.6.6.2.1 General\\n\\n8.6.6.2.2 Create a session \\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.6.2.2-1 illustrates the session with QoS create operation\\nbetween the EAS and the EES. It is used to request reservation of\\nresources for a data session between AC and EAS with a specific QoS and\\nto subscribe to certain session with QoS event notifications.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.6.2.2-1: Session with QoS API: create operation\\n\\n  1. The EAS requests establishment of a data session between the AC and\\n  the EAS with a specific QoS (either QoS reference or bandwidth). If\\n  the data session can adjust to different QoS parameter combinations,\\n  the request may include a list of alternative QoS references in a\\n  priority order. The EAS shall include the UE\\'s IP address, UE ID or UE\\n  Group ID, the DNN and S-NSSAI used for the data session between AC and\\n  EAS. With the same request the EAS subscribes to receive certain\\n  session with QoS event notifications (e.g. notifications related to\\n  QoS monitoring, usage monitoring for sponsored data connectivity\\n  and/or QoS targets can no longer (or can again) be fulfilled).\\n\\n2. The EES checks if the EAS is authorized for this operation for the\\nUE. If authorized, then the following services of 3GPP CN may be used by\\nthe EES:\\n\\na. the EES invokes the PFD management procedure with the 3GPP Core\\nNetwork as described in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.682\\xa0[10] and 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.502\\xa0[8] with\\nan application id. At least one of the IP flow description, domain\\ndescription or URI sent by the EAS is used for requesting PFD management\\nservice. Further the EES provides the same application id for requesting\\ndata session with specific QoS in step\\xa02c or step\\xa04.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa01: PFD management can be optionally supported in MNO. If EES cannot\\ninvoke step 2a, it responds EAS with appropriate error.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa02: The EES can map the EASID into the application id that is used\\nto invoke the PFD management procedure.\\n\\nb. the EES invokes the Event Monitoring service for PDU session status\\nwith the 3GPP Core Network, as described in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.502\\xa0[3].\\n\\nc. the EES invokes the Policy Authorization Create service or the AF\\nSession with QoS service with the 3GPP Core Network (PCF or NEF,\\nrespectively) as described in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2] and 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.502\\xa0[3],\\nproviding the specific QoS (QoS reference or bandwidth) to the PCF as\\ndescribed in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.503\\xa0[12], clause\\xa06.1.3.22. Additionally, the EES\\nmay subscribe to notifications of resource allocation outcome and to\\nother events described in clause\\xa06.1.3.18 of 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.503\\xa0[12], e.g.\\nnotifications of when the QoS targets can no longer (or can again) be\\nfulfilled.\\n\\nThe usage of step 2b and step 2c is as follows:\\n\\n- If the request is for a group of UEs identified by the UE Group ID or\\nfor a single UE identified by the UE ID, then EES executes step\\xa02b. If\\nUE (single UE or UE group member) already has ongoing PDU session, then\\nUE IP address is retrieved in step\\xa02b. Further the EES executes step\\xa02c;\\notherwise the EES waits for further notification for PDU session status\\nin step\\xa04.\\n\\n- If the request is for a single UE identified by the IP address, then\\nEES executes step 2c.\\n\\n3. If the operation in step\\xa02 is successful, the EES responds with a\\nContext ID and a Result. The Context ID is to be used by the EAS for\\nfurther requests (e.g. session with QoS update requests) pertaining to\\nthe same UE. If the EAS is not authorized or any other failure happens\\nduring the operation, the EES provides a rejection response with cause\\ninformation.\\n\\n4. When the EES receives the corresponding UE IP address for the single\\nUE or UE group member from the PDU session status notification sent by\\nthe 3GPP Core Network, the EES requests data session with specific QoS\\nas described in step\\xa02c.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa03: The EES will report the resource allocation outcome, e.g. the\\nsuccessful allocation of the Service Data Flow(s) related to the data\\nsession, with a separate session with QoS notify operation (see\\nTS\\xa023.503\\xa0[12], clause\\xa06.1.3.18).\\n\\n8.6.6.2.3 Update a session \\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.6.2.3-1 illustrates the session with QoS update request\\noperation between the EAS and the EES. It is used to request a\\nmodification of the QoS of the data session between AC and EAS.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.6.2.3-1: Session with QoS API: update operation\\n\\n1. The EAS requests a modification of the QoS of the data session\\nbetween the AC and the EAS, e.g. by including a different QoS reference\\nor different bandwidth value. The EAS shall include the Context ID.\\n\\nThe EAS may also request a modification of the event monitoring by\\nsubscribing to new events and updating or removing subscriptions to\\nexisting events.\\n\\n2. The EES checks if there is a context for the Context ID available and\\nwhether the EAS is authorized for this operation. If yes and the UE IP\\naddress is known by the EES, the EES invokes the Policy Authorization\\nUpdate service or AF Session with QoS Update service with the 3GPP Core\\nNetwork (PCF or NEF, respectively) as described in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2]\\nand 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.502\\xa0[3], providing the updated information to the PCF or\\nNEF, respectively. The EES may subscribe to additional events or\\nunsubscribe to certain events, if necessary.\\n\\n3. If the operation is successful, the EES responds with a Context ID\\nand a Result. If the EAS is not authorized or any other failure happens\\nduring the operation, the EES provides a rejection response with cause\\ninformation.\\n\\nNOTE: The EES will report the resource allocation outcome, e.g. the\\nsuccessful modification of the Service Data Flow(s) related to the data\\nsession, with a separate session with QoS notify operation (see\\n3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.503\\xa0[12], clause\\xa06.1.3.18).\\n\\n8.6.6.2.4 Revoke a session\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.6.2.4-1 illustrates the session with QoS revoke operation\\nbetween the EAS and the EES. It is used to revoke the data session\\nbetween AC and EAS with a specific QoS and to unsubscribe to the related\\nsession with QoS event notifications.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.6.2.4-1: Session with QoS API: revoke operation\\n\\n1. The EAS requests a revoke of the data session with QoS between the AC\\nand the EAS. The EAS shall include the Context ID.\\n\\n2. The EES checks if there is a context for the Context ID available and\\nwhether the EAS is authorized for this operation. If yes, then the EES\\nunsubscribes from the PDU session status monitoring (if applicable) and\\ninvokes the Policy Authorization Delete service or AF Session with QoS\\nRevoke service with the 3GPP Core Network (PCF or NEF, respectively) as\\ndescribed in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2] and 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.502\\xa0[3]. This deletes the\\napplication session context at the PCF or NEF and removes the\\nsubscription to any session with QoS event notifications.\\n\\n3. If the operation is successful, the EES responds with a Context ID\\nand a Result. If the EAS is not authorized or any other failure happens\\nduring the operation, the EES provides a rejection response with cause\\ninformation.\\n\\n8.6.6.2.5 Notify\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.6.2.5-1 illustrates the notify operation between the EES and\\nthe EAS for session with QoS event notifications.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.6.6.2.5-1: Session with QoS API: notify operation\\n\\n1. The EES detects a user plane event associated with the established\\nsession (i.e. it receives a Policy Authorization Notify operation from\\nthe PCF or an AF Session with QoS Notify operation from the NEF as\\ndescribed in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2] and 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.502\\xa0[3]). The EES\\ndetermines to notify the session with QoS event notification information\\n(e.g., resource allocation outcome or information that the QoS targets\\ncan no longer (or can again) be fulfilled) to the EASs which have\\nsubscribed to the session with QoS event notification.\\n\\n2.

The following mechanisms are supported:\\n\\n- Direct network capability exposure.\\n\\n- Network capability exposure via EES.\\n\\n8.7.2 Direct network capability exposure\\n\\nThe EAS(s) (acting as trusted or untrusted AF) may directly access the\\n3GPP Core Network capabilities as specified in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2] and\\n3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.682\\xa0[17].\\n\\nNOTE: An EAS may use its EASID, clause\\xa07.2.4, as the AF Identifier,\\n3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.502\\xa0[3] when invoking the capabilities of the 3GPP Core\\nNetwork.\\n\\n8.7.3 Network capability exposure via EES\\n\\nThe EES may re-expose the network capabilities of the 3GPP core network\\nto the EAS(s) as per the CAPIF architecture specified in\\n3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.222\\xa0[6].\\n\\nDepending on the deployment models (centralized or distributed)\\nemployed,\\n\\n- the EES assumes the role of the API exposing function (may also acts\\nas the API topology hiding entry) as described in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.222\\xa0[6];\\nand\\n\\n- the EAS assumes the role of an API invoker.\\n\\nIf CAPIF is supported, the EAS interacts with the CAPIF core function\\nand the EES. The EES may further interact with 3GPP northbound service\\nAPI provider (e.g. SCEF/NEF/SCEF+NEF) or directly with 3GPP core network\\nentities (e.g. PCF) to satisfy the service API invocation requests from\\nthe EASs.\\n\\nThe EES may expose the network capabilities of the 3GPP Core Networks to\\nthe EAS(s) by supporting the functionalities of 3GPP northbound service\\nAPI provider (e.g. SCEF, NEF, SCEF+NEF).\\n\\nNOTE\\xa01: Details of how to select a proper 3GPP network exposure function\\n(e.g. selecting NEF, SCEF, or SCEF+NEF) for the UE(s) is outside scope\\nof this specification.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa02: When interacting with the 3GPP northbound service provider, the\\nEES acting as an Application Function (AF) of the 3GPP CN\\n(3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.503\\xa0[12]) may use its EESID (as described in clause 7.2.3)\\nas the AF Identifier (3GPP\\xa0TS 23.502\\xa0[3]) for API invocations.\\nAlternatively, the EES can use the EASID (as described in clause 7.2.4)\\nof the EAS for which it is re-exposing the 3GPP core network\\ncapabilities as the AF Identifier.\\n\\n8.8 Service continuity\\n\\n8.8.1 General\\n\\n8.8.1.1 High level overview \\n\\nWhen a UE moves to a new location, different EASs can be more suitable\\nfor serving the ACs in the UE. Such transitions can result from a\\nnon-mobility event also, requiring support from the enabling layer to\\nmaintain the continuity of the service.\\n\\nThis clause describes the features that support service continuity for\\nACs in the UE to minimize service interruption while replacing the\\nS-EAS, with a T-EAS.\\n\\nGenerally, one AC on the UE has one associated application context at\\nthe S-EAS. To support service continuity, this application context is\\ntransferred from the S-EAS to a T-EAS.\\n\\nThe capabilities for supporting service continuity provided at the Edge\\nEnabler Layer may consider various application layer scenarios in which\\nthere may be involvement of AC and one or more EAS(s).\\n\\nFollowing intra-EDN, inter-EDN, between EDN and Cloud, and LADN\\n(overlapping LADN service areas) related scenarios are supported for\\nservice continuity:\\n\\n- UE mobility, including predictive or expected UE mobility;\\n\\n- Overload situations in S-EAS or EDN; and\\n\\n- Maintenance aspects such as graceful shutdown of an EAS.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa01: The scenarios which require ACR for service continuity, cannot\\nuse non-overlapping LADNs.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa02: Overload situations in S-EAS or EDN can be captured based on\\nedge load analytics via utilizing SEAL ADAE capability (see clauses 6.7\\nand 8.8 of TS\\xa023.436\\xa0[28]), which provide statistics or predictions on\\nthe expected load of S-EAS or EDN.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa03: The ACR between EDN and the Cloud may be triggered if no\\nsuitable target EAS is found.\\n\\nTo support the need of ACR, following entity roles are identified:\\n\\n- detection entity, detecting or predicting the need of ACR;\\n\\n- decision-making entity, deciding that the ACR is required; and\\n\\n- execution entity, executing ACR.\\n\\nA detection entity detects the probable need for ACR by monitoring\\nvarious aspects, such as UE\\'s location or predicted/expected UE location\\nand indicates to the decision-making entity to determine if the ACR is\\nrequired. The EEC, EES and EAS can potentially perform the detection\\nrole:\\n\\nA decision-making entity determines that ACR is required and instructs\\nthe execution entity to perform ACR. The decision-making entity makes a\\nACR decision to start the ACR execution. In different scenarios of ACR\\nin 8.8.2, the EEC, EAS, EES can potentially perform the decision role\\nrespectively.\\n\\nAn execution entity performs ACR as and when instructed by the\\ndecision-making entity. ACR execution starts with T-EAS discovery, which\\ncan be triggered by EEC, EAS and EES.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa03: After a decision that another EAS is to serve the UE, the S-EAS\\ncan decide if the existing Application Context is transferred to the new\\nEAS.\\n\\nThe EAS may utilize the following capabilities provided by the EES for\\nsupporting service continuity at the application layer:\\n\\n- Subscribe to service continuity related events and receive\\ncorresponding notifications;\\n\\n- Discover the T-EAS; and\\n\\n- ACR from a S-EAS to a T-EAS.\\n\\nThe EES can utilize the following capabilities provided by the ECS for\\nsupporting service continuity at the application layer:\\n\\n- Retrieve the T-EES.\\n\\nThe EEC may determine if the ACR is required by detecting that the UE\\nmoved or is predicted or expected to move outside the service area (see\\nclause\\xa07.3.3). The service area can be provided to the EEC by either the\\nECS during Service Provisioning or EES during EAS Discovery. For the PDU\\nSession of SSC mode 3, if the UE receives PDU Session Modification\\nCommand as specified in clause\\xa04.3.5.2 of 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.502\\xa0[3], the EEC\\nmay determine that the ACR is required. For IPv6 multi-homed PDU Session\\nof SSC mode 3, the EEC may determine that ACR is required if the UE is\\nnotified of the existence and availability of a new IPv6 prefix as\\nspecified in clause\\xa04.3.5.3 of 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.502\\xa0[3].\\n\\nNOTE\\xa04: For IPv6 multi-homed PDU Session of SSC mode 3, the EEC can be\\naware of the notification about the IPv6 prefix configuration due to\\nchange of PSA UPF based on the UE implementation.\\n\\nAfter successful ACR:\\n\\n- The EES is informed of the completion by the EAS; and\\n\\n- The EEC is informed of the completion by the EES.\\n\\nIn general, a number of steps are required in order to perform ACR. The\\npotential roles of an edge enablement layer in ACR include:\\n\\n- providing detection events;\\n\\n- selecting the T-EAS(s); and\\n\\n- supporting the transfer of the application context from the S-EAS(s)\\nto the T-EAS(s).\\n\\nIf the UE is connected to the 5GC, the EES/EAS acting as AF may utilize\\nAF traffic influence functionality from the 3GPP CN as specified in\\n3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.502\\xa0[3].\\n\\nA high level overview of ACR is illustrated in Figure\\xa08.8.1.1-1.\\n\\nFigure 8.8.1.1-1: High level overview of ACR\\n\\nACR can be performed for service continuity planning, which means that\\nthe first three steps in Figure 8.8.1.1-1 detection, decision and\\nexecution, are performed as defined in clause\\xa08.8.1.2, e.g. when the UE\\nis predicted to move outside the service area of the serving EAS. In\\nsuch a case the T-EAS is to service the UE when it moves to the expected\\nlocation.\\n\\nEES can handle multiple ACR requests simultaneously. When there are\\nmultiple simultaneous ACR, the ACR shall be uniquely identified by ACID,\\nEEC ID (or UE ID), S-EAS endpoint and T-EAS endpoint.\\n\\n8.8.1.2 ACR with service continuity planning\\n\\nService continuity planning is an Edge Enabler Layer value-add feature\\nof providing support for seamless service continuity, when information\\nabout planned, projected, or anticipated behaviour is available at EESs\\nor provided by EECs.\\n\\nTo implement this functionality an EES may utilize:\\n\\n- information provided by the EEC e.g., AC Schedule, Expected AC\\nGeographical Service Area, Expected AC Service KPIs, Preferred ECSP\\nlist; and\\n\\n- 3GPP core network capabilities utilized by EES as described in\\nclause\\xa08.10.3.\\n\\nIn service continuity planning, the Application Context may be\\nduplicated and sent from the S‑EAS to the T‑EAS before the UE moves to\\nthe expected location. In this case, the Application Contexts in S‑EAS\\nand T‑EAS are synchronized when the Application Context is updated until\\nthe AC connects to the T-EAS.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa01: The information elements of the Application Context and how the\\nApplication Context is synchronized between the S‑EAS and the T‑EAS is\\nup to implementation of the application.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa02: In the case of EELManagedACR, the Application Context\\nsynchronization is accomplished using the same mechanism as when\\ntransferring the context from the S‑EES to the T‑EES.\\n\\nFor additional details on service continuity planning for ACR, see\\nclauses\\xa08.8.2.2, 8.8.2.3, 8.8.2.4, 8.8.2.5 and 8.8.2.6.\\n\\n8.8.1.3 Unused contexts handling during ACR including service continuity planning\\n\\nThe interval between ACT initiation and ACR status update message from\\nEAS to EES (i.e. taking the context into use) can be significant (e.g.\\nin the predicted case). During this interval, the following events are\\npossible:\\n\\na) The UE remains communicating with the S-EAS, e.g. the UE does not\\nmove to the service area of the T-EAS; or\\n\\nb) The UE moves to a service area served by a different T-EAS (other\\nthan the T-EAS towards which the ACR was initiated).\\n\\nFor the ACRs initiated by the EEC, in case of events a) and b) the EEC\\nshould re-send an ACR request with the information of the current ACR\\nand the updated information as described in clause 8.8.3.4 and defined\\nin clause 8.8.4.4. For a) if the action is initiation the EEC sets T-EAS\\nendpoint under ACR initiation action to indicate the S-EAS. For b) if\\nthe action is initiation the UE sets T-EAS endpoint under ACR initiation\\naction to the new T-EAS.\\n\\nNOTE: Timeouts if required for discarding unused contexts for ACR\\nscenarios can be specified in stage 3.\\n\\n8.8.1.4 Modification of ACR parameters during ACR for service continuity planning\\n\\nDuring an ACR for service continuity planning, the circumstances can\\nchange which results in the changes in the parameters related to ACR. In\\nsuch cases modification of the ACR will be required. For example, the\\nEEC or EES can monitor the UE’s mobility and obtain updates in the\\npredicted location or other ACR parameters e.g. prediction expiration\\ntime.\\n\\nFor ACRs initiated by the S-EES, the S-EES may detect a change of the\\nexpected UE behaviour. In particular, S-EES acting as AF, may receive a\\nUE location report or a monitoring event report from 5GC (assuming that\\nS-EES has subscribed to consume 5GC services like LCS or NEF monitoring\\nevents related to UE actual location, or UE mobility analytics from\\nNWDAF). In case of a change in ACR parameters, e.g. prediction\\nexpiration time, the S-EES performs ACR parameter information procedure\\nas described in clause 8.8.3.9 to send the updated parameters to T-EES\\nand T-EAS\\n\\nFor the ACRs initiated by the EEC, the EEC/AC may detect a change of the\\nexpected UE location. For example, EEC may detect the UE location update\\nas a result of a UE mobility event or obtain an indication from the AC\\nthat the expected UE location or UE mobility or both are changed. In\\nthis case, in case of a change in ACR parameters, e.g. prediction\\nexpiration time, the EEC launches ACR with action \"ACR modification\"\\nwith the information identifying the current ACR and the updated\\nparameters as described in clause 8.8.3.4 and defined in clause 8.8.4.4.\\nIf the request is to the S-EES, the S-EES performs ACR parameter\\ninformation procedure as described in clause 8.8.3.9 to send the updated\\nparameters to T-EES and T-EAS.\\n\\nIf the ACR modification requires the change of T-EAS, this case is\\ndescribed in clause 8.8.1.3.\\n\\n8.8.1.5 Service continuity between CAS and EAS\\n\\nService continuity between CAS and EAS can be supported with CES or\\nwithout CES, corresponding to the architecture options described in\\nclause 6.2d and 6.2c.\\n\\nACR scenarios between CAS and EAS are described in clause 8.8.2A and\\nclause 8.8.2B.\\n\\n8.8.1.6 Service continuity for EAS bundle\\n\\nThis clause describes solution of relocating EASs in a bundle together\\ninstead of individual relocation for AC-EAS sessions one by one. To\\navoid ACR being triggered for each EAS in a bundle with different\\ninitiators (e.g. EAS 1 and EAS 2 in a bundle trigger ACR\\nsimultaneously), a main EAS may be used and a main EES is used\\ncorrespondingly. The main EAS or EES is responsible for ACR detection\\nand initiation in the network side. The main EAS information is sent to\\nEEL and the main EES is the EES registering the main EAS.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa01: ASP can have requirement of the dependencies between bundled\\nEAS(s) when provisioning them for any deployment scenario, and indicate\\nwhether the affinity between them as strong (co-deployment is essential)\\nor weak (co-deployment is only \"nice to have\").\\n\\nNOTE\\xa02: It is possible that some EASs in a bundle do not need relocation\\nbecause the UE can still be served by these EASs. A deployment example\\nis both EASs providing services covering the whole city and EASs\\nproviding services covering city district are serving the AC as an EAS\\nbundle, and when UE moves from one district to another district in the\\ncity, only EASs serving the district from where UE is moving out need\\nrelocation.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa03: In the proxy type of bundle, the main EAS is the connecting EAS\\nserving the AC.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa04: In current release of the specification, the main EAS is\\nselected by ASP.\\n\\n8.8.2 Scenarios\\n\\n8.8.2.1 General\\n\\nACR functionality can be implemented flexibly, and may be focused either\\nin the EEC or in the EAS/EES. The scenarios in this clause are different\\nwith regards to\\n\\na) whether the EEC is involved in the detection phase and decision phase\\nor detection and decision involve the S-EAS or S-EES only;\\n\\nb) whether T-EAS discovery is performed between EEC and T-EES or between\\nS-EES and T-EES;\\n\\nc) whether the EEC sends an Application Context Relocation Request\\ntowards the S-EES, the T-EES or none at all; and\\n\\nd) whether the Application Context is pushed from the S-EAS to the T-EAS\\nor pulled by the T-EAS from S-EAS.\\n\\nGenerally, AC, EEC, EES and EAS implementations will support only a\\nsubset of these scenarios; therefore, during EAS discovery and T-EAS\\ndiscovery the S-EES and T-EES shall take the ACR scenarios supported by\\nthe AC and EEC and any preferences indicated by the EEC for specific ACR\\nscenarios into account when identifying the EAS(s) for the EAS discovery\\nresponse, as specified in clause\\xa08.5.2.2 and clause\\xa08.8.3.2, or for the\\nEAS discovery notification, as specified in clause\\xa08.5.2.3.3.\\n\\nFurthermore, when the EEC performs EAS discovery or T-EAS discovery, the\\nEES or T-EES shall inform the EEC about the ACR scenarios which are\\nsupported by the EAS or T-EAS, respectively.\\n\\nThe EEC shall take the information about supported ACR scenarios\\nprovided by the ECS, S-EES and T-EES into account when selecting an EES\\nfor EAS discovery or T-EAS discovery, respectively, and when selecting\\nan EAS for edge services.\\n\\nFor clarity of description, scenarios in clauses 8.8.2.2, 8.8.2.3,\\n8.8.2.4, 8.8.2.5 and 8.8.2.6 describe the relocation of a single\\napplication context to a new EAS. Multiple ACs can be active in the UE\\nand relocation can be executed for each AC (or group of ACs) that\\nrequires service continuity.\\n\\nFor each of the scenarios in clauses 8.8.2.2, 8.8.2.3, 8.8.2.4, 8.8.2.5\\nand 8.8.2.6, ACR for one or more ACs can result in the same EEC\\nreceiving services from more than one EES, which have the registration\\nfor the required EASs that can serve the ACs. In scenarios described in\\nclause 8.8.2.4 and clause 8.8.2.5, a successful EEC context relocation\\nprocedure enables the EEC to become implicitly registered to the target\\nEES without the EEC sending an EEC registration request.\\n\\nIf selected ACR scenario list exists, the ACR scenarios are initiated\\nbased on this list.\\n\\n8.8.2.2 Initiation by EEC using regular EAS Discovery\\n\\nIn this scenario, ACR is a result of the UE moving to, or the UE\\nexpecting to move to, a new location which is outside the service area\\nof the serving EAS. The EEC is triggered as a result of the UE\\'s\\nmovement as described in 8.8.1.1 or by an AC as described in\\nclause\\xa08.14.2.4.\\n\\nThis scenario is based on Service Provisioning (as specified in\\nclause\\xa08.3) and EAS Discovery (as specified in clause\\xa08.5) procedures to\\ndiscover the T-EES and EAS that shall serve the AC as a result of the\\nUE\\'s new location, and that shall receive the Application Context from\\nthe serving EAS.\\n\\nThis scenario relies on the EDGE-5 interface between the EEC and AC.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The AC in the UE already has a connection to a corresponding S-EAS;\\n\\n2. The preconditions listed in clause\\xa08.3.3.2.2 with regards to the EEC\\nare fulfilled; and\\n\\n3. The EEC is triggered when it obtains the UE\\'s new location or is\\ntriggered by another entity such as an ECS notification or AC trigger.\\n\\nNOTE 1: This scenario is applicable only for an Edge-aware AC and EAS.\\n\\nFigure 8.8.2.2-1: ACR initiated by the EEC and AC\\n\\nPhase I: ACR Detection\\n\\n1. The EEC detects the UE location update as a result of a UE mobility\\nevent and is provided with the UE\\'s new location as described in\\nclause\\xa08.8.1.1. The EEC can also detect an expected or predicted UE\\nlocation in the future as described in clause 8.8.1.1.\\n\\nNOTE 2: If the EEC is triggered by an external entity such as by a\\nnotification from the ECS, a list of new EESs (to be used as T-EESs) is\\nprovided by that notification and step 3 below is skipped.\\n\\nPhase II: ACR Decision\\n\\n2. Either the AC or the EEC makes the decision to perform the ACR. If\\nthe EEC has received information of on-going ACR, then it should not\\ninitiate an ACR with the same ACR identity uniquely identified by ACID,\\nEEC ID (or UE ID), S-EAS endpoint and T-EAS endpoint again per clause\\n8.8.3.5.3.\\n\\nNOTE 3: Which applications require ACR can be decided based on the\\napplication profile, e.g. requirement of service continuity of the\\napplication.\\n\\nIf the change in UE\\'s location does not trigger a need to change the\\nserving EAS, steps 3 onwards are skipped. The EEC remains connected to\\nthe serving EES(s) and the AC remains connected to its corresponding\\nserving EAS.\\n\\nPhase III: ACR Execution\\n\\n3. The EEC performs Service Provisioning (as specified in clause\\xa08.3)\\nfor all active applications that require ACR. Since the location of the\\nUE has changed, the Service Provisioning procedure results in a list of\\nT-EESs that are relevant to the supplied applications and the new\\nlocation of the UE. When in step 1 the ACR for service continuity\\nplanning is triggered, then the Connectivity information and UE Location\\nin the Service Provisioning procedure (as specified in clause\\xa08.3)\\ncontains the expected Connectivity information and expected UE Location.\\n\\nIf Service Provisioning results in no T-EES, and if ACR to CAS is\\nsupported, then the procedure for ACR with CAS applies as specified in\\nclause 8.8.2A.2.\\n\\n4. The EEC performs EAS discovery (as specified in clause\\xa08.5) for the\\ndesired T-EASs by querying the T-EESs that were established in step 3\\n(or provided in the notification from the ECS – if it was the trigger).\\nIf EEC registration configuration for the EESs established in step 2\\nindicates that EEC registration is required, the EEC performs EEC\\nregistration with the EESs (as specified in clause 8.4.2.2.2) before\\nsending the EAS discovery request. Step 5 is skipped if EAS discovery\\nprocedure results in only one discovered T-EAS.\\n\\nWhen in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning is triggered, and\\nthe \"General context holding time duration\" is included in the replied\\nEAS discovery response, the EEC can make ACR request before it reaches\\nrespective T-EAS service area within the time period indicated by the\\nIE.\\n\\n5. The AC and EEC select the T-EAS to be used for the application\\ntraffic.\\n\\nNOTE 4: Several EEC registrations with different EESs may result from\\nT-EAS discovery process during a single ACR operation.\\n\\n6. The EEC performs ACR launching procedure (as described in\\nclause\\xa08.8.3.4) to the S-EES with predicted/expected UE location or\\nExpected AC Geographical Service Area, the ACR action indicating ACR\\ninitiation and the corresponding ACR initiation data (without the need\\nto notify the EAS). When the S-EES receives the predicted/expected UE\\nlocation or Expected AC Geographical Service Area from the EEC, then the\\nS-EES will determine to monitor the UE mobility. The S-EES may apply the\\nAF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of the T-EAS in the\\n3GPP Core Network (if applicable), as described in clause\\xa08.8.3.4. If\\nthe EEC has not subscribed to receive ACR information notifications for\\nACR complete events from the S-EES, the EEC subscribes for the\\nnotifications as described in clause\\xa08.8.3.5.2.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa05: It is expected that the AC will inform EAS about UE location\\nmonitoring is not needed\\n\\n7. If the T-EES is different than the S-EES and the EEC Context at the\\nS-EES is not stale, the S-EES initiates EEC Context Push relocation with\\nthe T-EES as described in clause 8.9.2.3. Otherwise, if the T-EES is the\\nsame as the S-EES, EEC Context Push relocation is skipped.\\n\\n8. The AC is triggered by the EEC to start ACT. The AC decides to\\ninitiate the transfer of application context from the S-EAS to the\\nT-EAS. There may be different ways of transferring context and they are\\nall outside the scope of this specification.\\n\\nWhen in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning has been\\ntriggered, the AC connects to the T-EAS when the UE moves to the\\npredicted location. Otherwise, the rest of this step is skipped.\\n\\nAfter the ACT is completed, the AC remains connected to the T-EAS and\\ndisconnects from the S-EAS; the EEC is informed of the completion.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa06: Whether and how the AC initiates the ACT is out of scope of the\\npresent document\\n\\nWhen in step 1 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity\\nplanning, if the UE does not move to the expected/predicted location the\\nEEC does not connect to T-EES, the AC does not connect to the T-EAS.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa07: The S-EAS or T-EAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and\\nthe T-EAS can discard the application context based on information\\nreceived from EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of\\nthe UE). It is up to the implementation of the S-EAS and T-EAS whether\\nand how to make such a decision.\\n\\n  NOTE\\xa08: It is out of scope of this specification how the AC informs\\n  the S-EAS and T-EAS that ACT was part of service continuity planning.\\n  When in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning is triggered,\\n  the S-EAS and the T-EAS can wait for the UE to move to the predicted\\n  location before they perform the Post ACR Clean up steps 9 and 10 if\\n  it is the EAS monitoring whether the UE moves to the\\n  predicted/expected location. When the S-EAS and the T-EAS do not wait\\n  for the UE (e.g., if the UE does not move to the predicted location),\\n  the S-EAS and the T-EAS can perform the Post ACR Clean up with failure\\n  messages.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa09: If the S-EAS and T-EAS are main EASs forming proxy bundle, other\\nEASs of the bundle may transfer the application contexts in this step.\\nHow to execute ACT is out of scope of this document.\\n\\nPhase IV: Post-ACR Clean up\\n\\n9. The S-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the S-EES as\\nspecified in clause\\xa08.8.3.8.\\n\\n10. The T-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the T-EES as\\nspecified in clause\\xa08.8.3.8. If the status indicates a successful ACT,\\nand that the EEC Context relocation procedure was attempted but failed,\\nthen the T-EES indicates the failure to the T-EAS with the ACR status\\nupdate response.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa010: If the EDGE-3 subscription initialization result indicates\\nfailure, then the EAS can perform the required EDGE-3 subscriptions at\\nthe T-EES.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa011: Steps 9 and 10 can occur in any order.\\n\\n11. If the status in step 9 indicates a successful ACT, for non-planning\\ncase the S-EES sends the ACR information notification (ACR complete)\\nmessage immediately to the EEC to confirm that the ACR has completed as\\nspecified in clause\\xa08.8.3.5.3. For the service continuity planning case,\\nif it is EES monitors the UE mobility, then only when S-EES detects the\\nUE has moved to the predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC\\nGeographical Service Area and the status in step 9 indicates a\\nsuccessful ACT, then the S-EES sends ACR information notification (ACR\\ncomplete) message to the EEC indicating that UE has moved to the\\npredicted location when the ACR type is service continuity planning. If\\nthe EEC Context relocation procedure was attempted, then the\\nnotification includes EEC context relocation status IE, indicating the\\nresult of the EEC context relocation procedure. If the EEC context\\nrelocation status indicates that the EEC context relocation was not\\nsuccessful, then the EEC may perform the required EDGE-1 operations such\\nas create subscriptions at the T-EES.\\n\\n8.8.2.3 EEC executed ACR via S-EES\\n\\nIn this scenario, the EEC is triggered as a result of the UE\\'s movement\\nas described in 8.8.1.1 or by an AC as described in clause 8.14.2.4.\\nFigure\\xa08.8.2.3-1 illustrates the EEC executing ACR via the S-EES.\\n\\nPre-condition:\\n\\n1. The AC at the UE already has a connection to the S-EAS; and\\n\\n2. The EEC is able to communicate with the S-EES.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.2.3-1: EEC executed ACR\\n\\nPhase I: ACR Detection\\n\\n1. The EEC detects that ACR may be required as described in\\nclause\\xa08.8.1.1. The EEC may detect that ACR may be required for an\\nexpected or predicted UE location in the future as described in\\nclause\\xa08.8.1.1.\\n\\nPhase II: ACR Decision\\n\\n2. The EEC decides to proceed required procedures for triggering ACR. If\\nthe EEC has received information of on-going ACR, then it should not\\ninitiate an ACR with the same ACR identity uniquely identified by ACID,\\nEEC ID (or UE ID), S-EAS endpoint and T-EAS endpoint again per clause\\n8.8.3.5.3.\\n\\nPhase III: ACR Execution\\n\\n3. The EEC determines the T-EES by using the provisioned information or\\nperforming service provisioning procedure per clause\\xa08.3 of the present\\ndocument. When in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning is\\ntriggered, then the Connectivity information and UE Location in the\\nService Provisioning (as specified in clause\\xa08.3) procedure contains the\\nexpected Connectivity information and expected UE Location. If the UE is\\nwithin the service area of the T-EES, upon selecting T-EES the UE may\\nneed to establish a new PDU connection to the target EDN. If EEC\\nregistration configuration for the T-EES indicates that EEC registration\\nis required, the EEC performs EEC registration with the selected T-EES\\nas specified in clause 8.4.2.2.2. The EEC can then discover and select\\nT-EAS by performing EAS Discovery with the T-EES per clause\\xa08.5.2 of the\\npresent document.\\n\\nIf service provisioning results in no T-EES, and if ACR to CAS is\\nsupported, then the procedure for ACR with CAS applies as specified in\\nclause 8.8.2A.3.\\n\\nWhen in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning is triggered, and\\nthe \"General context holding time duration\" is included in the replied\\nEAS discovery response, the EEC can make ACR request before it reaches\\nrespective T-EAS service area within the time period indicated by the\\nIE.\\n\\nNOTE 1: Several EEC registrations with different EESs may result from\\nT-EAS discovery process during a single ACR operation.\\n\\n4a. The EEC performs ACR launching procedure (as described in\\nclause\\xa08.8.3.4) to the S-EES with predicted/expected UE location or\\nExpected AC Geographical Service Area, the ACR action indicating ACR\\ninitiation and the corresponding ACR initiation data (with the need to\\nnotify the EAS). The S-EES authorises the request from the EEC. The\\nS-EES decides to execute ACR based on the information received from the\\nEEC, EEC context and/or EAS profile. The S-EES may apply the AF traffic\\ninfluence with the N6 routing information of the T-EAS in the 3GPP Core\\nNetwork (if applicable) and sends the ACR management notification for\\nthe \"ACT start\" event to the S-EAS, as described in clause 8.6.3, to\\ninitiate ACT between the S-EAS and the T-EAS. In ACT start, the S-EES\\nincludes indication of service continuity planning if the S-EES\\ndetermine to monitor UE mobility. If the EEC has not subscribed to\\nreceive ACR information notifications for ACR complete events from the\\nS-EES, the EEC subscribes for the notifications as described in\\nclause\\xa08.8.3.5.2.\\n\\n4b. If the ACR request in step 4a includes ACR parameters, e.g.\\nPrediction expiration time, the S-EES performs ACR parameter information\\nprocedure by sending the ACR parameter information request to the T-EES\\nas described in clause 8.8.3.9.\\n\\n  5. If the T-EES is different than the S-EES and the EEC Context at the\\n  S-EES is not stale, the S-EES initiates EEC Context Push relocation\\n  with the T-EES as described in clause 8.9.2.3. Otherwise, if the T-EES\\n  is the same as the S-EES, EEC Context Push relocation is skipped.\\n\\n6. The S-EAS transfers the application context to the T-EAS at\\nimplementation specific time.

If the ACR\\nmanagement notification indicates \"ACR monitoring\" event, then the\\nnotification will also contain the T-EAS information (see\\nclause\\xa08.6.3.2.3).

The T-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the T-EES as\\nspecified in clause\\xa08.8.3.8. If the status indicates a successful ACT,\\nand that the EEC Context relocation procedure was attempted but failed,\\nthen the T-EES indicates the failure to the T-EAS with the ACR status\\nupdate response.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa08: If the EDGE-3 subscription initialization result indicates\\nfailure, then the EAS can perform the required EDGE-3 subscriptions at\\nthe T-EES.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa09: Steps 8 and 9 can occur in any order.\\n\\n10. If the status in step 8 indicates a successful ACT, for non-planning\\ncase the S-EES sends the ACR information notification (ACR complete)\\nmessage immediately to the EEC to confirm that the ACR has completed as\\nspecified in clause\\xa08.8.3.5.3. For the service continuity planning case,\\nif it is EES monitors the UE mobility, then only when S-EES detects the\\nUE has moved to the predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC\\nGeographical Service Area and the status in step 8 indicates a\\nsuccessful ACT, then the S-EES sends ACR information notification (ACR\\ncomplete) message to the EEC indicating that UE has moved to the\\npredicted location when the ACR type is service continuity planning. If\\nthe EEC Context relocation procedure was attempted, then the\\nnotification includes EEC context relocation status IE, indicating the\\nresult of the EEC context relocation procedure. If the EEC context\\nrelocation status indicates that the EEC context relocation was not\\nsuccessful, then the EEC may perform the required EDGE-1 operations such\\nas create subscriptions at the T-EES.\\n\\n8.8.2.5 S-EES executed ACR\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.2.5-1 illustrates the S-EES detecting, deciding and executing\\nACR from the S-EAS to the T-EAS. This may include EELManagedACR by S-EES\\nwhen initiated by S-EAS as per clause\\xa08.8.3.6. The EEC or the S-EAS may\\nalso detect the ACR as illustrated in figure 8.8.2.5-1.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa01: For this clause, S-EAS either supports ACR detection capability\\nor performs subscription for ACR management event to EES.\\n\\nPre-condition:\\n\\n1. The AC at the UE already has a connection to the S-EAS;\\n\\n2. The EEC is able to communicate with the S-EES;\\n\\n3. The EEC has subscribed to receive ACR information notifications for\\ntarget information notification events and ACR complete events from the\\nS-EES, as described in clause\\xa08.8.3.5.2;\\n\\n4. The S-EAS optionally subscribed to receive ACR management\\nnotifications for \"ACR facilitation\" events to the S-EES, in order to\\nenable detection at S-EAS.\\n\\n  5. In case of EELManagedACR, the T-EAS has subscribed to receive ACT\\n  status notifications as described in clause\\xa08.8.3.6.2.3.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.2.5-1: S-EES executed ACR\\n\\n1. The S-EAS may initiate EELManagedACR with S-EES as specified in\\nclause\\xa08.8.3.6. The S-EAS and S-EES negotiate an address of the\\nApplication Context storage to S-EES. The S-EAS puts the Application\\nContext at this address which can be further accessed by the S-EES when\\nthe ACT is required.\\n\\nIn the EELManagedACR case, the S-EES executes steps 2 (i.e., S-EES is\\nthe detection entity), 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 14. Rest of\\nsteps are skipped.\\n\\nPhase I: ACR Detection\\n\\n2. Detection entities (S-EAS, S-EES, EEC) detect that ACR may be\\nrequired and identify the ACID and Predicted/Expected UE location or\\nExpected AC Geographical Service Area as described in clause 8.8.1.1.\\nThe detection by the S-EES may be triggered by the User Plane path\\nchange notification received from the 3GPP Core Network due to S-EAS\\nrequest for \"ACR facilitation\" event (see clause\\xa08.6.3) or due to step\\n1.\\n\\nThe detection entity may detect that ACR may be required for an expected\\nor predicted UE location in the future as described in clause\\xa08.8.1.1.\\n\\nPhase II: ACR Decision\\n\\n3. The detection entity performs ACR launching procedure (as described\\nin clause 8.8.3.4) with the ACR action indicating ACR determination and\\nthe corresponding ACR determination data. If the EEC or S-EAS detect the\\nACR event, the EEC or S-EAS may inform S-EES with ACID, and\\npredicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area\\nin the ACR launching procedure.\\n\\n4. The S-EES authorises the message if received. The S-EES decides to\\nexecute ACR based on the information received or local detection, and\\nthe information of EEC context or EAS profile, and then proceed the\\nbelow steps. When the S-EES receives the predicted/expected UE location\\nor Expected AC Geographical Service Area from the EEC or the EAS in ACR\\ndetermination, or the S-EES received service continuity planning from\\nEAS in ACR facilitation event subscription, then the S-EES will\\ndetermine to monitor the UE mobility. If S-EES has received information\\nof on-going ACR, then it should not initiate an ACR with the same ACR\\nidentity uniquely identified by ACID, EEC ID (or UE ID), S-EAS endpoint\\nand T-EAS endpoint again per clause 8.6.3.2.3.\\n\\nPhase III: ACR Execution\\n\\n5a. The S-EES determines T-EES and T-EAS via the Discover T-EAS\\nprocedure in clause\\xa08.8.3.2 of the present document. When in step 2 the\\nACR has been triggered for service continuity planning, then UE Location\\nand Target DNAI values provided in the Retrieve T-EES procedure contain\\nthe expected UE Location and expected Target DNAI. The S-EES may decide\\nnot to perform ACR if T-EAS is not available.\\n\\nIf T-EAS discovery results in no T-EAS, and if ACR to CAS is supported,\\nthen the procedure for ACR with CAS applies as specified in clause\\n8.8.2A.5.\\n\\n5b. If required, the S-EES performs ACR parameter information procedure\\nby sending the ACR parameter information request to the T-EES as\\ndescribed in clause 8.8.3.9. For example, when the ACR is for service\\ncontinuity planning, and the S-EES has received it in ACR launch in step\\n2, the S-EES sends ACR parameter information request which includes\\nPrediction expiration time.\\n\\n  6. If the T-EES is different than the S-EES and the EEC Context at the\\n  S-EES is not stale, the S-EES initiates EEC Context Push relocation\\n  with the T-EES as described in clause 8.9.2.3. Otherwise, if the T-EES\\n  is the same as the S-EES, EEC Context Push relocation is skipped.\\n\\n7. The S-EES sends the target information notification to the EEC as\\ndescribed in clause\\xa08.8.3.5.3.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa02: Step 7 can be performed after step 5. The S-EES can send target\\ninformation notification to the EEC immediately after having the target\\ninformation in order to avoid EEC to initiate another ACR with the same\\nidentity\\n\\n8. The S-EES may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing\\ninformation of the T-EAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable).\\n\\n9. The S-EES sends the ACR management notification (e.g. as notification\\nfor \"ACR facilitation\" event or \"ACT start\" event as described in clause\\n8.6.3 or due to step 1) to the S-EAS to initiate ACT between the S-EAS\\nand the T-EAS.\\n\\n10. The Application Context is transferred from S-EAS to the T-EAS at\\nimplementation specific time. In the case of EELManagedACR, the S-EES\\naccesses the Application Context from the address as per step 1 and the\\nS-EES and T-EES engage in the ACT from S-EAS to the T-EAS (obtained as\\nper step 5) in a secure way. Further the T-EAS accesses the Application\\nContext made available by the T-EES. If S-EAS performs the ACT directly\\nwith T-EAS, the specification of such process is out of scope of the\\npresent document.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa03: The Application Context is encrypted and protected by the\\napplication layer. The S-EES and the T-EES engage in the packet level\\ntransport of the Application Context and they have no visibility to the\\ncontent of the Application Context.\\n\\nWhen in step 2 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity\\nplanning, if the UE does not move to the predicted location, the EEC\\ndoes not connect to T-EES, the AC does not connect to the T-EAS.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa03: The S-EAS or T-EAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and\\nthe T-EAS can discard the application context based on information\\nreceived from EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of\\nthe UE). It is up to the implementation of the S-EAS and T-EAS whether\\nand how to make such a decision.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa04: When in step 2 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity\\nplanning, the S-EAS and the T-EAS can wait for the UE to move to the\\npredicted location before they perform the Post ACR Clean up steps 12\\nand 13 if it is the EAS monitoring whether the UE moves to the predicted\\nor expected location. When the S-EAS and the T-EAS do not wait for the\\nUE (e.g., if the UE does not move to the predicted location), the S-EAS\\nand the T-EAS can perform Post ACR Clean up with failure messages.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa05: If the S-EAS and T-EAS are main EASs forming proxy bundle, other\\nEASs of the bundle may transfer the application contexts in this step.\\nHow to execute ACT is out of scope of this document.\\n\\nPhase IV: Post-ACR Clean up\\n\\n11. In case of EELManagedACR, once the ACT is successful, the T-EES\\nsends an ACT status notification to the T-EAS as described in clause\\n8.8.3.6.2.4, indicating that the Application Context is available.\\n\\n12. The S-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the S-EES as\\nspecified in clause\\xa08.8.3.8.\\n\\n13. The T-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the T-EES as\\nspecified in clause\\xa08.8.3.8. If the status indicates a successful ACT,\\nand that the EEC Context relocation procedure was attempted but failed,\\nthen the T-EES indicates the failure to the T-EAS with the ACR status\\nupdate response.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa06: If the EDGE-3 subscription initialization result indicates\\nfailure, then the EAS can perform the required EDGE-3 subscriptions at\\nthe T-EES.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa07: Steps 12 and 13 can occur in any order.\\n\\n14. If the status in step 12 indicates a successful ACT or in the\\nEELManagedACR case, the S-EES sends the ACR information notification\\n(ACR complete) message immediately to the EEC to confirm that the ACR\\nhas completed as specified in clause\\xa08.8.3.5.3. For the service\\ncontinuity planning case, if it is EES monitors the UE mobility, then\\nonly when S-EES detects the UE has moved to the predicted/expected UE\\nlocation or Expected AC Geographical Service Area and the status in step\\n12 indicates a successful ACT, then the S-EES sends ACR information\\nnotification (ACR complete) message to the EEC when the ACR type is\\nservice continuity planning. If the EEC Context relocation procedure was\\nattempted, then the notification includes EEC context relocation status\\nIE, indicating the result of the EEC context relocation procedure. If\\nthe EEC context relocation status indicates that the EEC context\\nrelocation was not successful, then the EEC may perform the required\\nEDGE-1 operations such as create subscriptions at the T-EES.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa08: The Application Client mechanism to support switchover of the\\napplication traffic to T-EAS is out of scope of the specification.\\n\\n8.8.2.6 EEC executed ACR via T-EES\\n\\nIn this scenario, the EEC is triggered as a result of the UE\\'s movement\\nas described in 8.8.1.1 or by an AC as described in clause\\xa08.14.2.4.\\nFigure\\xa08.8.2.6-1 illustrates the EEC executing ACR via the T-EES.\\n\\nPre-condition:\\n\\n1. The EEC has the S-EAS information that serves the AC.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.2.6-1: EEC executed ACR via T-EES\\n\\nPhase I: ACR Detection\\n\\n1. The EEC detects that ACR may be required as described in\\nclause\\xa08.8.1.1. The EEC may detect that ACR may be required for an\\nexpected or predicted UE location in the future as described in\\nclause\\xa08.8.1.1.\\n\\nPhase II: ACR Decision\\n\\n2. The EEC decides to proceed with required procedures for ACR. If the\\nEEC has received information of on-going ACR, then it should not\\ninitiate an ACR with the same ACR identity uniquely identified by ACID,\\nEEC ID (or UE ID), S-EAS endpoint and T-EAS endpoint again per clause\\n8.8.3.5.3.\\n\\nNOTE 1: If supported, the AC can be involved in the decision. It is out\\nof scope of the present document how the AC is involved.\\n\\nPhase III: ACR Execution\\n\\n3. The EEC determines the T-EES by using the provisioned information or\\nperforming service provisioning procedure per clause\\xa08.3. When in step 1\\nthe ACR for service continuity planning is triggered, then the\\nConnectivity information and UE Location used in the service\\nprovisioning procedure contain the expected Connectivity information and\\nexpected UE Location. If the UE is within the service area of the T-EES,\\nupon selecting the T-EES the UE may need to establish a new PDU\\nconnection to the target EDN. If EEC registration configuration for the\\nT-EES indicates that EEC registration is required, the EEC performs\\nregistration with the selected T-EES as specified in clause 8.4.2.2.2.\\nThe EEC performs EAS Discovery with the T-EES per clause\\xa08.5.2.\\n\\nWhen in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning is triggered, and\\nthe \"General context holding time duration\" is included in the replied\\nEAS discovery response, the EEC can make ACR request before it reaches\\nrespective T-EAS service area within the time period indicated by the\\nIE.\\n\\nNOTE 2: Several EEC registrations with different EESs may result from\\nT-EAS discovery process during a single ACR operation.\\n\\n4. The EEC performs ACR launching procedure (as described in\\nclause\\xa08.8.3.4) to the T-EES with predicted/expected UE location or\\nExpected AC Geographical Service Area, the ACR action indicating ACR\\ninitiation and the corresponding ACR initiation data (with the need to\\nnotify the EAS). When the T-EES receives the predicted/expected UE\\nlocation or Expected AC Geographical Service Area from the EEC, then the\\nT-EES will determine to monitor the UE mobility. If the received ACR\\ninitiation request contains an EEC context ID and the S-EES Endpoint,\\nthe T-EES performs an EEC Context Pull relocation (clause\\xa08.9.2.2). The\\nT-EES may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information\\nof the T-EAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable). Then the T-EES\\nsends the ACR management notification with \"ACT start\" event message to\\nthe T-EAS, the T-EES includes indication of service continuity planning\\nif the T-EES determines to monitor UE mobility during post-ACR phase. If\\nthe ACR request in ACR launching procedure includes ACR parameters, e.g.\\nPrediction expiration time, the T-EES includes the ACR parameters in the\\nnotification to T-EAS. The EEC also subscribes to receive ACR\\ninformation notifications for ACR complete events from the T-EES, as\\ndescribed in clause\\xa08.8.3.5.2.\\n\\n5. The T-EAS initiates ACT between the S-EAS and the T-EAS. This process\\nis out of scope of the present specification.\\n\\n  When in step 1 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity\\n  planning, if the UE does not move to the predicted location the EEC\\n  does not connect to T-EES, the AC does not connect to the T-EAS.\\n\\nNOTE 3: The S-EAS or T-EAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and\\nthe T-EAS can discard the application context based on information\\nreceived from EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of\\nthe UE). It is up to the implementation of the S-EAS and T-EAS whether\\nand how to make such a decision.\\n\\nNOTE 4: When in step 1 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity\\nplanning, the S-EAS and the T-EAS can wait for the UE to move to the\\npredicted location before the T-EAS performs the Post ACR Clean up step\\n6 if it is the EAS monitoring whether the UE moves to the\\npredicted/expected location. When the S-EAS and the T-EAS do not wait\\nfor the UE (e.g., if the UE does not move to the predicted location),\\nthe T-EAS can perform Post ACR Clean up with failure messages.\\n\\n  NOTE\\xa05: If the S-EAS and T-EAS are main EASs forming proxy bundle,\\n  other EASs of the bundle may transfer the application contexts in this\\n  step. How to execute ACT is out of scope of this document.\\n\\nPhase IV: Post-ACR clean up\\n\\n6. The T-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the T-EES as\\nspecified in clause\\xa08.8.3.8. If the status indicates a successful ACT,\\nand that the EEC Context relocation procedure was attempted but failed,\\nthen the T-EES indicates the failure to the T-EAS with the ACR status\\nupdate response.\\n\\nNOTE 6: If the EDGE-3 subscription initialization result indicates\\nfailure, then the EAS can perform the required EDGE-3 subscriptions at\\nthe T-EES.\\n\\n7. The T-EES immediately sends the ACR information notification (ACR\\ncomplete) message to the EEC as described in clause\\xa08.8.3.5.3 for\\nnon-planning case. For the service continuity planning case, if it is\\nEES monitors the UE mobility, then only when T-EES detects the UE has\\nmoved to the predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical\\nService Area and the status in step 6 indicates a successful ACT, then\\nthe S-EES sends ACR information notification (ACR complete) message to\\nthe EEC indicating that UE has moved to the predicted location when the\\nACR type is service continuity planning. If the EEC Context relocation\\nprocedure was attempted, then the notification includes EEC context\\nrelocation status IE, indicating the result of the EEC context\\nrelocation procedure. If the EEC context relocation status indicates\\nthat the EEC context relocation was not successful, then the EEC may\\nperform the required EDGE-1 operations such as create subscriptions at\\nthe T-EES.\\n\\nIf the procedure fails after step 4, it will be terminated with an\\nappropriate cause in the ACR information notification to the EEC in step\\n7. The EEC may then proceed attempting to obtain services from the T-EAS\\ndiscovered in step 3 without service continuity support. Alternatively,\\nthe EEC may resume the present procedure starting with step 4 and\\nselecting a different T-EES discovered in step 3 with EAS service\\ncontinuity support.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa07: The support of ACR between EDNs operated by different ECSPs is\\ndependent on business agreement between the ECSPs.\\n\\n8.8.2.7 ACR for direct EAS bundle, executed by EEC\\n\\nIn this scenario, the EEC executes necessary ACR for AC-EAS service\\nsession(s) in a bundle, and it follows the scenario described in clause\\n8.8.2.3 with the following differences:\\n\\n- all T-EAS(s) in a bundle requiring service continuity are discovered\\nand selected during step 3. If the affinity is set to strong, then\\nT-EASs are from the same EDN.\\n\\nNOTE: T-EAS(s) should be within the same EDN as preferred if EAS\\naffinity is preferred, or different EDNs if no T-EAS(s) in same EDN\\navailable, if the EAS affinity is set to weak.\\n\\n- all bundled T-EAS endpoints are sent to the corresponding S-EES(s) in\\nthe ACR request and the S-EES(s) may apply AF traffic influence for the\\nreceived T-EAS(s) in step 4a.\\n\\n- Each associated EES (i.e. EES serving bundle EASs) aggregates ACR\\nstatus update from its served and bundled EASs in step 7 and step 8 and\\nsends ACR complete notification to the EEC in step 9.\\n\\n- The EEC collects ACR complete notifications in step 9 and completes\\nthe ACR for the EAS bundle.\\n\\n8.8.2.8 ACR for EAS bundle, executed by S-EAS\\n\\nIn this scenario, the main S-EAS executes and triggers necessary ACR for\\nall AC-EAS service session(s) in a bundle.\\n\\nThis scenario description is same as described for figure 8.8.2.4-1\\nexcept for the following clarifications:\\n\\nPre-condition:\\n\\n1. The main S-EAS may depend on the receipt of ACR management events\\nfrom its S-EES, e.g. \"user plane path change\" events or \"ACR monitoring\"\\nevents as described in clause 8.6.3, to detect the need for an ACR. The\\nmain S-EAS may also depend on the receipt of UE location notification\\nfrom its S-EES as described in clause 8.6.2.2.3, to detect the need for\\nan ACR. For the following procedure it is assumed that the main S-EAS\\nhas subscribed to continuously receive the respective events; and\\n\\n2. The EEC has subscribed to receive ACR information notifications for\\ntarget information notification events and ACR complete events from\\nS-EESs serving the EAS bundle, as described in clause\\xa08.8.3.5.2.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.2.8-1: S-EAS executed ACR for EAS bundle\\n\\nPhase I: ACR Detection\\n\\n1.

The main S-EAS performs ACR decision for bundled EASs.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa01: The main S-EAS is aware of all bundle EASs service area and/or\\nDNAIs so it can decide whether to perform ACR for the corresponding\\nEASs.\\n\\nPhase III: ACR Execution\\n\\n3. The main S-EAS discovers from all candidate T-EAS(s) in EAS bundle as\\ndescribed in clause 8.8.3.2. If the affinity is set to strong, then\\nT-EASs are from the same EDN. The main S-EAS may apply AF traffic\\ninfluence for all bundled T-EAS(s).\\n\\nNOTE: T-EAS(s) should be within the same EDN as preferred if EAS\\naffinity is preferred, or different EDNs if no T-EAS(s) in same EDN\\navailable, if the EAS affinity is set to weak.\\n\\n4. The procedure is same as step 4 to step 6 of clause 8.8.2.4. The main\\nS-EAS sends selected T-EAS declaration message to the main S-EES with\\nthe selected T-EASs, the main S-EES sends selected T-EAS(s) to the EEC.\\n\\n5. The main S-EES informs associated S-EESs with bundled T-EASs. Then\\nACT starts between the S-EAS(s) and T-EAS(s) in a bundle requiring\\nservice continuity.\\n\\nPhase IV: Post-ACR Clean up\\n\\n6. During post-ACR, all S-EASs and T-EASs send ACR status update to\\nS-EES and T-EES, respectively, as described in step 8 and step 9 of\\nclause 8.8.2.4. The EEC collects ACR complete notifications from all\\nS-EESs and ACR for EAS bundle is completed.\\n\\n8.8.2.9 ACR for EAS bundle, executed by S-EES\\n\\nIn this scenario, a main S-EES (serving a main S-EAS) executes and\\ntriggers necessary ACR for AC-EAS service session(s) in a bundle.\\n\\nThis scenario description is same as described for figure 8.8.2.5-1\\nexcept for the following clarifications:\\n\\nPre-condition:\\n\\n1. The AC at the UE already has a connection with S-EASs in a bundle;\\n\\n2. The EEC subscribes to receive ACR information notifications for\\ntarget information notification events and ACR complete events from\\nS-EESs serving the EAS bundle, as described in clause\\xa08.8.3.5.2;\\n\\n3. The main S-EAS may subscribe to receive ACR management notifications\\nfor \"ACR facilitation\" events to the main S-EES, in order to enable ACR\\ndetection at the main S-EES.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.2.9-1: S-EES executed ACR for EAS bundle\\n\\nPhase I: ACR Detection\\n\\n1. The main S-EES detects the need for ACR, the procedure is same as\\nstep 2 of clause 8.8.2.5.\\n\\nPhase II: ACR Decision\\n\\n2. The main S-EES performs ACR decision for bundled EASs.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa01: The main S-EES is aware of all bundle EASs service area and/or\\nDNAIs so it can decide whether to perform ACR for the corresponding\\nEASs.\\n\\nPhase III: ACR Execution\\n\\n3. The main S-EES discovers all candidate T-EAS(s) in EAS bundle as\\ndescribed in clause 8.8.3.2. If the affinity is set to strong, then\\nT-EASs are from the same EDN.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa02: T-EAS(s) should be within the same EDN as preferred if EAS\\naffinity is preferred, or different EDNs if no T-EAS(s) in same EDN\\navailable, if the EAS affinity is set to weak.\\n\\n4. The procedure is same as step 5b to step 10 of clause 8.8.2.5. The\\nmain S-EES sends selected T-EAS(s) to the EEC, triggers application\\ntraffic influence for T-EAS(s) and notifies the main S-EAS with selected\\nT-EAS of the same EAS service. The main S-EES may notify more S-EAS(s)\\nwith selected T-EAS of the corresponding EAS service.\\n\\n5. The main S-EES performs ACR launching procedure (as described in\\nclause\\xa08.8.3.4) with the ACR action indicating ACR initiation and the\\ncorresponding ACR initiation data to the associated S-EES(s).\\n\\n6. The associated S-EES(s) notifies the corresponding bundled S-EAS(s)\\nand ACT starts between the S-EAS(s) and T-EAS(s) in a bundle requiring\\nservice continuity.\\n\\nPhase IV: Post-ACR Clean up\\n\\n7. During post-ACR, all S-EASs and T-EASs send ACR status update to\\nS-EES and T-EES, respectively, as described in step 12 and step 13 of\\nclause 8.8.2.5. The EEC collects ACR complete notifications from all\\nS-EESs and ACR for EAS bundle is completed.\\n\\n8.8.2A Scenarios for ACR between EAS and CAS\\n\\n8.8.2A.1 General\\n\\nService continuity between CAS and EAS is supported without CES,\\ncorresponding to the architecture options described in clause 6.2c. The\\nACR can be triggered by a change or expected change in UE location or in\\ncase of an overload situation or maintenance aspects in the S-EAS or EDN\\nif no suitable target EAS is found as described in clause 8.8.1.1\\ndepending on the scenario.\\n\\nTo facilitate future ACRs from the CAS back to EAS, the EEC may request\\nand receive an AF-specific UE ID or Edge UE ID from the S-EES as\\ndescribed in clause 8.6.5, which can be used by the CAS to perform EAS\\ndiscovery on the S-EES when there is an ACR from CAS back to an EAS. The\\nEEC may also request to subscribe to notifications from the S-EES via\\nthe SEAL notification management service as described in clause 9.1 to\\nreceive ACR notifications if the EEC is no longer within reach from the\\nS-EES.\\n\\n8.8.2A.2 Enabling ACR with CAS - Initiation by EEC using regular EAS Discovery\\n\\nIn this scenario, ACR is a result of the UE moving to, or the UE\\nexpecting to move to, a new location which is outside the service area\\nof the serving EAS. It further relies on the EEC being triggered as a\\nresult of the UE\\'s movement.\\n\\nThis scenario is based on Service Provisioning (as specified in\\nclause\\xa08.3) and DNS procedures to discover the CAS that shall serve the\\nAC as a result of the UE\\'s new location, and that shall receive the\\nApplication Context from the serving EASs. The scenario below describes\\nthe relocation of a single application context to a CAS. However, it\\nshould be repeated for each active AC in the UE for which EAS or EDN is\\nnot available on that UE location.\\n\\nThis scenario description is same as described for figure 8.8.2.2-1\\nexcept for the following clarifications:\\n\\nPre-conditions: Same pre-conditions apply described for figure\\n8.8.2.2-1.\\n\\nFigure 8.8.2A.2-1: Enabling ACR with CAS - Initiation by EEC using\\nregular EAS Discovery\\n\\nPhase I: ACR Detection\\n\\n1. Same as step 1 described for figure 8.8.2.2-1.\\n\\nPhase II: ACR Decision\\n\\n2. Same as step 2 described for figure 8.8.2.2-1.\\n\\nPhase III: ACR Execution\\n\\n3. The EEC performs Service Provisioning (as specified in clause\\xa08.3)\\nfor all active applications that require ACR. Since the location of the\\nUE has changed, this procedure results in unavailability of T-EESs that\\nare relevant to the supplied applications and the new location of the\\nUE.\\n\\n4. If the change in the UE\\'s location triggers a need to change the\\nS-EAS but the EEC is not provided with a T-EAS, the EEC informs the AC\\nof the unavailability of a suitable EDN for the new location of the UE.\\n\\n5. The AC triggers the UE to perform DNS resolution for the CAS relevant\\nfor the AC. The UE may need to establish a new PDU connection to the\\nCAS.\\n\\n6. The AC sends ACR request to the EEC and the EEC responds ACR response\\nto the AC.\\n\\n7. The EEC performs ACR launching procedure (as described in\\nclause\\xa08.8.3.4) to the S-EES with the ACR action indicating ACR\\ninitiation and the corresponding ACR initiation data (along with the\\ndetails of the CAS and without the need to notify the EAS). The S-EES\\nmay apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of\\nthe CAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable), as described in\\nclause\\xa08.8.3.4. Based on the received CAS information, the S-EES informs\\nthe CAS with the S-EES endpoint information by selected EES declaration\\nrequest as described in clause 8.8.3.10.\\n\\n8.

The EEC performs Service Provisioning (as specified in clause\\xa08.3)\\nfor all active applications that require ACR. Since the location of the\\nUE has changed, this procedure results in unavailability of T-EESs that\\nare relevant to the supplied applications and the new location of the\\nUE. Service provisioning or discovery of relevant T-EAS may not result\\nin EES configuration or T-EAS is not discovered respectively. If no\\nT-EES is available based on service provisioning response, the AC or\\nEECtriggers the UE to perform DNS resolution for the cloud application\\nserver relevant for the AC as described in clause 8.14.2.5.3, 8.14.3.12\\nand 8.14.3.15. The UE may need to establish a new PDU connection to the\\nCAS.\\n\\n4. The EEC performs ACR launching procedure (as described in\\nclause\\xa08.8.3.4) to the S-EES with the ACR action indicating ACR\\ninitiation and the corresponding ACR initiation data (along with the\\ndetails of the CAS and with the need to notify the EAS). The S-EES\\nauthorises the request from the EEC. The S-EES decides to execute ACR\\nbased on the information received from the EEC and/or EAS profile. The\\nS-EES may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information\\nof the CAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable) and sends the ACR\\nmanagement notification for the \"ACT start\" event to the S-EAS, as\\ndescribed in clause 8.6.3, to initiate ACT between the S-EAS and the\\nCAS. Based on the received CAS information, the S-EES informs the CAS\\nwith the S-EES endpoint information by selected EES declaration request\\nas described in clause 8.8.3.10. If the EEC has not subscribed to\\nreceive ACR information notifications for ACR complete events from the\\nS-EES, the EEC subscribes for the notifications as described in\\nclause\\xa08.8.3.5.2.\\n\\n5. The S-EAS transfers the application context to the CAS at\\nimplementation specific time. This process is out of scope of the\\npresent specification.\\n\\nNOTE 1: The S-EAS or CAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and\\nthe CAS can discard the application context based on information\\nreceived from EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of\\nthe UE).

Same as step 9 described for figure 8.8.2.3-1.\\n\\nNOTE 2: The CAS can perform capability exposure subscription with 3GPP\\nCN directly, upon receiving the application context, which may be\\nhelpful for handling future ACR scenarios e.g. ACR from cloud to edge.\\n\\n8.8.2A.4 Enabling ACR with CAS - S-EAS decided ACR\\n\\nIn this scenario, the S-EAS may detect the need of ACR locally or is\\nnotified by the S-EES via ACR management notifications for \"ACR\\nmonitoring\" events. The S-EAS make the decision about whether to perform\\nthe ACR, and starts the ACR at a proper time.\\n\\nThis scenario description is same as described for figure 8.8.2.4-1\\nexcept for the following clarifications:\\n\\nPre-conditions: Same pre-conditions apply described for figure\\n8.8.2.4-1.\\n\\nFigure 8.8.2A.4-1: Enabling ACR with CAS - S-EAS decided ACR scenario\\n\\nS-EAS decided ACR is outlined with four main phases: detection,\\ndecision, execution and clean up.\\n\\nPhase I: ACR Detection\\n\\n1.

If the ACR required is self detected, the S-EAS requests the S-EES to\\ndiscover the targets. When S-EES determines that no relevant EAS is\\navailable for the UE\\'s location, the discovery response returns T-EAS\\ndiscovery failure. After S-EAS determines to use CAS and performs the\\nDNS query/discovery, the S-EAS may apply the AF traffic influence with\\nthe N6 routing information of the CAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if\\napplicable).\\n\\n4. The S-EAS sends selected CAS declaration message to S-EES, to inform\\nS-EES the determined CAS to use as described in clause 8.8.3.7, where\\nT-EAS in that procedure is assumed to be CAS. Based on the received CAS\\ninformation, the S-EES informs the CAS with the S-EES endpoint\\ninformation by selected EES declaration request as described in clause\\n8.8.3.10.\\n\\n5. Based on the CAS selection information received from the S-EAS, the\\nS-EES sends the target information notification to the EEC as described\\nin clause\\xa08.8.3.5.3.\\n\\n6. The S-EAS transfers the application context to the CAS selected in\\nstep 3. This process is out of scope of the present specification.\\n\\nNOTE 1: The S-EAS or CAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and\\nthe CAS can discard the application context based on information\\nreceived from EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of\\nthe UE).

The S-EES determines the targets via the Discover T-EAS procedure in\\nclause\\xa08.8.3.2.\\n\\nIf T-EAS discovery fails, then S-EES triggers DNS query message using\\nthe endpoint information (e.g., FQDN) in the S-EAS profile.\\n\\nBased on the determination of CAS, the S-EES informs the CAS with the\\nS-EES endpoint information by selected EES declaration request as\\ndescribed in clause 8.8.3.10. For EELmanagedACR, the CAS subscribe to\\nS-EES to receive ACT status notifications.\\n\\n6. Same as step 7 described for figure 8.8.2.5-1.\\n\\n7. The S-EES may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing\\ninformation of the CAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable).\\n\\n8. The S-EES sends the ACR management notification (e.g. as notification\\nfor \"ACR facilitation\" event or \"ACT start\" event as described in clause\\n8.6.3 or due to step 1) to the S-EAS to initiate ACT between the S-EAS\\nand the CAS.\\n\\n9. The Application Context is transferred from S-EAS to the CAS at\\nimplementation specific time. In the case of EELManagedACR, the S-EES\\naccesses the Application Context from the address as per step 1 and the\\nS-EES either engage in the ACT from S-EAS to the CAS (obtained as per\\nstep 5) in a secure way. Further the CAS accesses the Application\\nContext. The S-EAS may also perform the ACT directly with CAS, the\\nspecification of such process is out of scope of the present document.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa01: The Application Context is encrypted and protected by the\\napplication layer. The S-EES engages in the packet level transport of\\nthe Application Context and has no visibility to the content of the\\nApplication Context.\\n\\nNOTE 2: The S-EAS or CAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and\\nthe CAS can discard the application context based on information\\nreceived from EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of\\nthe UE). It is up to the implementation of the S-EAS and CAS whether and\\nhow to make such a decision.\\n\\nPhase IV: Post-ACR Clean up\\n\\n10. Same as step 11 described for figure 8.8.2.5-1.\\n\\n11. Same as step 12 described for figure 8.8.2.5-1.\\n\\n12. If the status in step 11 indicates a successful ACT, the S-EES sends\\nthe ACR information notification (ACR complete) message to the EEC to\\nconfirm that the ACR has completed as specified in clause\\xa08.8.3.5.3.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa03: The Application Client mechanism to support switchover of the\\napplication traffic to CAS is out of scope of the specification.\\n\\n8.8.2A.6 CAS decided ACR scenario via last S-EES\\n\\nIn this scenario, the CAS detects the need for ACR and makes the\\ndecision about whether to perform the ACR and starts the ACR at a proper\\ntime.\\n\\nDuring the ACR execution phase, the CAS may need to determine an EES in\\nthe service area of the EEC before continuing with T-EAS discovery. The\\nCAS may send the EAS discovery request to the S-EES that selects an\\nappropriate T-EES and T-EAS as per clause 8.8.3.2 where the CAS acts as\\na S-EAS.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n- The CAS has a business relationship with the ECSP, otherwise, the EES\\nwill reject the CAS request during authorization.\\n\\n- Prior to being connected to the CAS, the EEC was connected to an S-EES\\nthat may still hold its context and the CAS knows the S-EES (e.g. as in\\nclause 8.8.3.10 when ACR is performed from EAS to CAS).\\n\\n- AC has obtained the UE ID as per clause 8.14.2.6 and forwarded it to\\nthe CAS while performing ACR from EAS to CAS as described in clause\\n8.8.2A.1 or the CAS knows UE ID having used the procedure defined in\\nclause 8.6.5.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.2A.6-1: CAS decided ACR with T-EAS Discovery via S-EES\\n\\nPhase I: ACR Detection\\n\\n1. The CAS detects the need for ACR. The CAS either receives ACR\\nmanagement notifications from S-EES indicating that ACR may be required\\n(\"ACR monitoring\" event), or self detects the need for ACR (e.g. upon\\nreceipt of a \"user plane path change\" event).\\n\\nPhase II: ACR Decision\\n\\n2. The CAS makes the decision to perform the ACR.\\n\\nPhase III: ACR Execution\\n\\n3. Same as steps 3 to 5 in clause 8.8.2.4 where the CAS acts as an S-EAS\\nand it may provide the UE ID in the T-EAS discovery request for the\\nS-EES to identify the UE during discovery. If ACR monitoring event is\\nused in step 1, the T-EAS discovery in step 3 of clause 8.8.2.4 is\\nskipped by the CAS.\\n\\n4. If the S-EES can communicate with the EEC, step 6 from clause 8.8.2.4\\nis performed to notify the EEC of the selected T-EES. Otherwise, the\\nnotification is sent to the EEC via the SEAL notification management\\nservice as described in clause 9.1 if the EEC has subscribed to receive\\nnotifications from the S-EES or via Application Triggering via core\\nnetwork.\\n\\n5. Same as step 7 in clause 8.8.2.4 where the CAS acts as an S-EAS.\\n\\nPhase IV: Post-ACR Clean up\\n\\n6. Same as step 8 to step 9 in clause 8.8.2.4 where the CAS acts as an\\nS-EAS.\\n\\n7. If the S-EES can communicate with the EEC, step 10 from clause\\n8.8.2.4 is performed. Otherwise, the notification is sent to the EEC via\\nthe SEAL notification management service as described in clause 9.1 if\\nthe EEC has subscribed to receive notifications from the S-EES or via\\nApplication Triggering via core network.\\n\\n8.8.2B Scenarios for ACR between EAS and CAS with CES\\n\\n8.8.2B.1 General\\n\\nSince the EAS may have service area restriction, once the UE is moving\\nout of the current edge coverage, to keep service continuity, the\\napplication client needs to communicate with the CAS. The ACR can also\\nbe triggered in case of an overload situation or maintenance aspects in\\nthe S-EAS or EDN if no suitable target EAS is found as described in\\nclause 8.8.1.1 depending on the scenario. Service continuity between CAS\\nand EAS is supported with CES, corresponding to the architecture options\\ndescribed in clause 6.2d.\\n\\nCAS(s) are registered in the CES via CLOUD-1 reference point which\\nenables the CES to provide appropriate CAS to S-EAS or S-EES.\\n\\nDNS can be used for CAS discovery by the UE.\\n\\nThe EES of the source EDN may interact with the CES via ECI-4 reference\\npoint and application context is transferred from source EAS to the CAS.\\nLater, if the UE is moving to an area with edge coverage, the CES may\\ninteract with the EES in the target EDN via ECI-4 reference point and\\napplication context is transferred from the CAS to target EAS.\\n\\n8.8.2B.2 ACR from edge to cloud\\n\\n8.8.2B.2.1 General\\n\\nThe following clauses describe ACR scenarios from edge to cloud.\\n\\n8.8.2B.2.2 Initiation by EEC using regular EAS Discovery\\n\\nThe scenario described in clause 8.8.2A.2 applies with the following\\ndifferences:\\n\\n- After step 7, the S-EES relocates context to the CES.

The CAS subscribes to CES with\\nACR management events with \"ACR facilitation\" for ACR detection and step\\n5a T-EAS discovery is skipped.\\n\\nNOTE: Detection by other entities is not specified in this release.\\n\\n8.8.3 Procedures\\n\\n8.8.3.1 General\\n\\n8.8.3.2 Discover T-EAS\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.2-1 illustrates the procedure for fetching T-EAS\\ninformation. This procedure may be utilized by a S-EAS, which undertakes\\nthe transfer of application context information to a T-EAS directly, or\\ncan be invoked by the S-EES itself on deciding to execute ACR.\\n\\nT-EAS discovery procedure also supports EAS retrieval which enables a\\nS-EAS to obtain T-EAS(s) serving the application group so that the S-EAS\\ncan start communication with obtained EAS(s) for EAS synchronization.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. Information related to the EES is available with the S-EAS, if the\\nprocedure is triggered by the S-EAS.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.2-1: Discover T-EAS\\n\\n1a. The S-EAS sends the EAS discovery request to the S-EES or the S-EES\\ndecides to execute the ACR. The EAS discovery request from the S-EAS\\nincludes the requestor identifier [EASID] along with the security\\ncredentials and includes EAS discovery filter matching its EAS profile.\\nIf target DNAI is available at the S-EAS via User Plane Path change\\nevent, the S-EAS provides the S-EES with the target DNAI. The S-EAS also\\nincludes an EAS service continuity support indicator indicating that the\\nS‑EAS decided ACR according to clause\\xa08.8.2.4 is to be used for the ACR.\\nThe S-EAS includes the bundle ID and bundle type indicating the proxy\\nbundle case to which the S-EAS belongs to. The request may include\\nprediction expiration time.\\n\\nThe EAS may send EAS discovery request with EAS ID, Application Group ID\\nand EAS synchronization support, which indicates the request to obtain\\nEAS(s) currently serving the Application Group ID with the requested EAS\\nID in order to perform EAS synchronization.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa01: The trigger condition to invoke the Discover T-EAS API is up to\\napplication service logic, which is out of scope of this specification.\\n\\n1b. The S-EES either receive the target DNAI for T-EES discovery from\\nthe step 1a or by the user plane management event notification from the\\ncore network.\\n\\n2. If the request is received from the S-EAS, the S-EES checks whether\\nthe requesting EAS is authorized to perform the discovery operation.\\n\\nIf Application Group ID and EAS synchronization support in EAS\\ncharacteristics are received and the ECS-ER is available, the S-EES\\nchecks with the ECS-ER with the received EAS ID and Application Group ID\\nand obtains a list of EAS(s) supporting EAS synchronization and serving\\nthe application group for the desired application service identified by\\nthe EAS ID as described in clause 8.20. Step 2 to step 4 are skipped.\\n\\nIf the UE location is not known to the S-EES or provided by the S-EAS\\nrequest, then the S-EES may interact with 3GPP core network to retrieve\\nthe UE location. If the S-EES decided to execute the ACR or when the\\nrequesting EAS is authorized, the S-EES checks if there exists a T-EAS\\ninformation (registered or cached) that can satisfy the requesting EAS\\ninformation, additional query filters and the Expected AC Service KPIs\\nand the Minimum required AC Service KPIs if received from the EEC during\\nthe EAS discovery or from the S-EAS in step 1. In this case, the S-EES\\nmay collect Edge load performances from ADAES or OAM to find T-EAS(s)\\nthat satisfies the Expected AC service KPIs or the Minimum required AC\\nService KPIs. The S-EES may determine the use of statistics or\\nprediction for evaluating KPIs based on the situation of the T-EAS\\ndiscovery. If the S-EES finds the T-EAS(s) in the cached or registered\\ninformation, the flow either continues with step\\xa05 for the S-EAS\\ntriggered discovery or stops for the S-EES decided ACR execution, else\\nthe S-EES retrieves the T-EES address from the ECS as specified in\\nclause\\xa08.8.3.3 and continues with step 3.\\n\\n3. The S-EES invokes the EAS discovery request on the T-EES retrieved\\nfrom the ECS. The EAS discovery request includes the requestor\\nidentifier [EESID] along with the security credentials and includes EAS\\ndiscovery filter. In the EAS discovery filter, the S-EES may include\\nprediction expiration time, the Expected AC Service KPIs and the Minimum\\nrequired AC Service KPIs if received from the EEC during the EAS\\ndiscovery or from the S-EAS in step 1.\\n\\nThe S-EES also includes the EEC service continuity support indicator\\nreceived from the EEC during EAS discovery. If in step 1 the S-EES\\nreceived an EAS service continuity support indicator from the S-EAS,\\nthen the S-EES includes this EAS service continuity support indicator\\nand its own EES service continuity support indicator indicating the ACR\\nscenarios supported by the EES. If in step 1 the S-EES decided to\\nexecute the ACR, the S-EES includes the EAS service continuity support\\nindicator received from the S-EAS during EAS registration and includes\\nan EES service continuity support indicator indicating that the S‑EES\\nexecuted ACR according to clause\\xa08.8.2.5 is to be used for the ACR.\\n\\nUpon receiving the request, the T-EES may trigger the ECSP management\\nsystem to instantiate the T-EAS that matches with EAS discovery filter\\nIEs (e.g. ACID) as in clause\\xa08.12.\\n\\n4. The T-EES discovers the T-EAS(s) and responds with the discovered\\nT-EAS information to the S-EES. To filter T-EAS(s), the T-EES utilizes\\nthe discovery filters (e.g. Expected AC Service KPIs and the Minimum\\nrequired AC Service KPIs) and the indications which ACR scenarios are\\nsupported by the AC, the EEC, the T-EES and the S-EAS. If T-EES gets the\\nExpected AC service KPIs or the Minimum required AC Service KPIs, the\\nT-EES may collect edge load analytics from ADAES (as specified in clause\\n8.8.2 of TS\\xa023.436\\xa0[28]) or performance data from OAM to find T-EAS(s)\\nthat satisfies the Expected AC service KPIs or the Minimum required AC\\nService KPIs. The T-EES may determine the use of statistics or\\nprediction for evaluating KPIs based on the situation of the T-EAS\\ndiscovery. The S-EES may cache the T-EAS information.\\n\\nWhen the bundle EAS information (i.e. list of EASID) is provided and the\\nbundle type indicating the direct bundle, and the S-EES received\\nassociated T-EES(s) along with part of EAS ID list in the step2 from the\\nECS, then the S-EES discover the target direct bundle EAS(s) which\\nbelongs to same EDN for all the associated S-EES(s). The request message\\ncontains direct bundle EAS(s) information (i.e. list of EASID and direct\\nbundle type). Then the S-EES receives the direct bundle T-EAS(s)\\ninformation from each associated T-EES(s).\\n\\nNOTE\\xa02: T-EES(s) may belongs to same EDN.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa03: The edge load analytics from ADAES can be either statistics or\\npredictions on the T-EAS.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa04: The statistical KPI value can be used for both normal ACR and\\nservice continuity planning.\\n\\n5. If the request was received from the S-EAS, the S-EES responds to the\\nS-EAS with the discovered T-EAS Information.\\n\\nFor responding S-EAS requesting EAS serving the application group, only\\nEAS endpoint and EAS ID are included in EAS profile of Discovered EAS\\nlist.\\n\\n8.8.3.3 Retrieve T-EES procedure\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.3-1 illustrates the procedure for the S-EES to retrieve the\\nT-EES information from the ECS.\\n\\nPre-condition:\\n\\n1. The S-EES has been pre-configured with the address of the ECS; and\\n\\n2. The AC at the UE already has on-going application traffic with the\\nS-EAS.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.3-1: Retrieve T-EES procedure\\n\\n1. The S-EES sends the Retrieve EES request (UE location information or\\nUE identity, EASID of the S-EAS, bundle ID, bundle type (i.e. proxy\\nbundle case), target DNAI and UE connectivity information) to the ECS in\\norder to identify the T-EES which has an EAS available to serve the\\ngiven AC in the UE. For obtaining announcement EES list, the Retrieve\\nEES request includes application group id. The request message may also\\ncontain the AC, EEC service continuity support information.\\n\\n2. If the request contains the UE identity (e.g. GPSI) but the UE\\nlocation is not known to the ECS, then the ECS interacts with 3GPP core\\nnetwork to retrieve the UE location. The ECS determines T-EES(s) as per\\nthe parameters (e.g. EASID, target DNAI) in the request and the UE\\nlocation information. If the request message contains the AC, EEC\\nservice continuity support information, then the ECS may identify the\\nT-EES taking the AC, EEC, T-EES service continuity support into\\nconsideration. When the bundle ID and is provided and bundle type\\nindicating the proxy bundle case then the ECS can identify the T-EES\\nbased on the bundle ID in the EES profile and in the request message to\\nensure T-EAS is able to invoke the required proxy bundle EAS(s) as the\\nS-EAS does.\\n\\nIf no ECS-ER is available and when the Retrieve EES request includes\\napplication group id to the ECS then the request EES list retrieval is\\nfor the announcement of common EAS, ECS determines the list of EESs\\nserving the EASs (with same EASID) for the Group ID included in the\\nRetrieve EES request.\\n\\nIf the ECS does not identify any suitable EES(s) based on EDN\\nconfiguration available at the ECS and UE’s location, the ECS determines\\na partner ECS that may satisfy the requirements. Based on ECSP policy,\\nthe ECS may use preconfigured or OAM configured information about the\\npartner ECSs or ECS discovery via ECS-ER as specified in clause\\xa08.17.2.3\\nor both.\\n\\nIf required by the ECSP policies, the ECS may use service provisioning\\ninformation retrieval procedure as specified in clause\\xa08.17.2.4 to\\nobtain service provisioning information from the partner ECS.\\n\\nWhen the bundle EAS information is provided, then if bundle EAS\\ninformation includes a list of EASIDs, then the ECS identifies the one\\nor more T-EES associated with the same EDN which support all of the EASs\\nwithin the same EDN based on the EES EDN information obtained in the EES\\nprofile.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa01: T-EES(s) may belongs to same EDN.\\n\\n3. The ECS sends the Retrieve EES response. If the ECS has determined\\nthe EDN configuration information, the retrieve EES response includes\\nthe list of EDN configuration information to the S-EES. The list of EDN\\nconfiguration information includes the EDN details with the endpoint\\ninformation of T-EES(s) as described in table\\xa08.3.3.3.3-2.

When S-EES receives\\nmultiple associated T-EES(s), then each associated T-EES information is\\nprovided along with the part of the EAS ID list.\\n\\nIf the retrieve EES response contains a list of ECS configuration\\ninformation, the S-EES may initiate retrieve T-EES procedure with one or\\nmore ECS(s) listed in the retrieve EES response.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa02: The Retrieve EES request initiated by the S-EES can be\\nrestricted only to its registered ECS.\\n\\n8.8.3.4 ACR launching procedure\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.4-1 illustrates the ACR launching procedure by the EEC or\\nthe S‑EAS or the S-EES.\\n\\nIf this procedure is triggered by the EEC, depending on the ACR action\\nindicated in the ACR request, the procedure is used for ACR initiation,\\nACR determination or ACR modification which is described in clause\\n8.8.1.4. The procedure of the ACR initiation can be re-sent as described\\nin clause 8.8.1.3 to cancel an ACR.\\n\\nIf this procedure is triggered by the S‑EAS, the procedure is used for\\nACR determination.\\n\\nIf this procedure is triggered by the S-EES to the associated S-EES(s),\\nthis procedure is used for the direct bundle EAS case.\\n\\nPre-condition:\\n\\nFor EEC as consumer:\\n\\n1. The EEC has been authorized to communicate with the EES as specified\\nin clause\\xa08.11, if the procedure is triggered by the EEC.\\n\\nFor S-EAS as consumer:\\n\\n1.

The S-EES obtained the associated S-EES(s) information as specified\\nin clause 8.15.2.2.\\n\\n[]\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.4-1: ACR launching procedure\\n\\n1. The EEC or the S‑EAS sends an ACR request message to the EES in order\\nto start ACR. The ACR request message may include Predicted/Expected UE\\nlocation or Expected AC Geographical Service Area to indicate that the\\nEES should detect whether the UE has moves to the Predicted/Expected UE\\nlocation or Expected AC Geographical Service Area or not in ACR clean-up\\nphase. The ACR request message includes ACR action to indicate either\\nACR initiation request or ACR determination request. If the procedure is\\ntriggered by the S‑EAS, the ACR request message is only for ACR\\ndetermination.\\n\\nAn ACR request for ACR initiation sent by the EEC:\\n\\n- includes an indication of whether the EEC requests the EES to perform\\nEAS notification; and\\n\\n  - provides information used by EES to perform AF traffic influence as\\n  in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023\\xa0501\\xa0[2].The EEC sent ACR request for ACR initiation\\n  shall include the simultaneous EAS connectivity information in service\\n  continuity (see table 8.8.4.4-1) if previously received as part of the\\n  AC profile.\\n\\n  An ACR request for ACR determination sent either by the EEC or the EAS\\n  informs the EES that the need for ACR has been detected by the\\n  requestor.\\n\\nAn ACR request for ACR modification sent by the EEC:\\n\\n- includes IDs to identify the ACR that is requested to be modified; and\\n\\n  - includes the ACR parameters to be modified.\\n\\n  An ACR request for direct bundle EAS case sent by the S-EES:\\n\\n- includes direct bundle T-EAS(s) received in step 4 in 8.8.3.2 related\\nto the associated S-EES(s) based on the EASID, which EASID of the\\nassociated S-EES is corresponding to the direct bundle T-EAS(s) profile.\\n\\n2. The EES checks if the requestor is authorized for this operation. If\\nauthorized, the EES processes the request and performs the required\\noperations.\\n\\nIf the request in step 1 is for ACR initiation:\\n\\n- the EES may use information provided in the request to apply the AF\\ntraffic influence with the N6 routing information of the T-EAS in the\\n3GPP Core Network (if applicable), as described in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2],\\nclause\\xa05.6.7.1; and\\n\\nNOTE: The simultaneous EAS connectivity information sent by EES is used\\nto maintain both S-PSA and T-PSA in supporting simultaneous connectivity\\nwith both S-EAS and T-EAS during the service continuity as described in\\nclause\\xa06.3.4 of 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.548\\xa0[20].\\n\\nEditor\\'s note: Since the 3GPP CN only supports simultaneous PSA\\nconnectivity in SSC mode 3 or session breakout, it is FFS whether EES\\nshould firstly know PDU session capability before invoking AF traffic\\ninfluence API.\\n\\n- if the EAS notification indication in ACR initiation data is provided\\nin the step\\xa01 request and the EAS has subscribed to receive such\\nnotification, the EES shall notify the EAS indicated in the ACR\\ninitiation data about the need to start ACR by sending an ACR management\\nnotification for the \"ACT start\" event, as described in clause 8.6.3.\\n\\nIf the request in step 1 is for ACR determination, the EES decides to\\nexecute ACR as described in clause\\xa08.8.2.5.\\n\\nIf the request in step 1 includes Previous T-EAS Endpoint:\\n\\n- if the previous EAS notification indication is provided in the step\\xa01\\nrequest and the EAS has subscribed to receive such notification, the EES\\nshall notify the EAS about the cancellation of the ACR with the previous\\nT-EAS by sending an ACR management notification for the \"ACT stop\"\\nevent, as described in clause 8.6.3.\\n\\n- The EAS will inform the remote EAS about application context\\ncancellation, which is outside the scope of this specification. The\\nT-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the T-EES which will\\ninclude failed result with an appropriate cause indicating the reason\\nfor the failure.\\n\\nIf the request in step 1 is for ACR modification:\\n\\n- the EES identifies the ACR to be modified based on the ID parameters\\nin the request in step 1. If the request in step 1 is to the S-EES, the\\nS-EES performs the ACR parameter information procedure as described in\\nclause 8.8.3.9. If the request in step 1 is to the T-EES, and if the\\nT-EAS has subscribed to receive ACR notifications, the T-EES shall\\nnotify the T-EAS by sending an ACR management notification, with \"ACT\\nstart\" event including ACR parameters from the request in step 1, e.g.\\nPrediction expiration time.\\n\\nIf the request in step1 is for direct bundle EAS case, then the\\nassociated T-EES may use received direct bundle T-EAS(s) for ACR.\\n\\n3. The EES responds to the requestor\\'s request with an ACR response\\nmessage.\\n\\nIn case of re-sending ACR initiation, if serving EES was changed and EEC\\ncontext was relocated, the T-EES can clean up any relocated EEC context\\neither indicated in the re-sent ACR request for scenario described in\\nclause 8.8.2.6 or upon reception of the ACR status update with failed\\nresult from T-EAS for other scenarios.\\n\\n8.8.3.5 ACR information subscription\\n\\n8.8.3.5.1 General\\n\\nClause 8.8.3.5.2 and clause\\xa08.8.3.5.3 together illustrate the ACR\\ninformation procedure based on Subscribe/Notify model.\\n\\nThe ACR information procedure is utilized as a building block for a part\\nof Post-ACR Clean up in clause\\xa08.8.2 and Target information\\nnotification.\\n\\n8.8.3.5.2 Subscribe\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.5.2-1 illustrates the ACR information subscription\\nprocedure between the EEC and the EES.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EEC has received information (e.g. URI, IP address) related to\\nthe EES;\\n\\n2. The EEC has received appropriate security credentials authorizing it\\nto communicate with the EES as specified in clause\\xa08.11; and\\n\\n3. The EEC has optionally acquired a Notification Target Address to be\\nused in its subscriptions to notifications.\\n\\nNOTE: How the EEC acquires the notification target address or a\\nnotification channel URI to receive the notifications is out of scope of\\nthis release. The notification target address can terminate at the EEC\\n(e.g. in an IoT device) if the deployment supports EEC reachability, or\\nit can terminate at a push notification service. Details of the push\\nnotification service are out of scope of this release.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.5.2-1: ACR information subscription\\n\\n1. The EEC sends an ACR information subscription request to the EES. The\\nrequest from EEC may include the ACIDs to indicate to the EES which ACs\\nare served by the EEC that need to receive ACR information via EEL.\\n\\n2. Upon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES checks if the EEC is\\nauthorized to subscribe ACR information about the requested EAS(s). If\\nthe request is authorized, the EES creates and stores the subscription\\nfor ACR information.\\n\\n3. The EES sends an ACR information subscription response to the EEC,\\nwhich includes the subscription identifier and may include the\\nexpiration time, indicating when the subscription will automatically\\nexpire. To maintain the subscription, the EEC shall send an ACR\\ninformation subscription update request prior to the expiration time. If\\nan ACR information subscription update request is not received prior to\\nthe expiration time, the EES shall treat the EEC as implicitly\\nunsubscribed.\\n\\n8.8.3.5.3 Notify\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.5.3-1 illustrates the ACR information notification\\nprocedure between the EEC and the EES, which can be used by the EES to\\nnotify the EEC of the following:\\n\\n- target information, i.e. the details of the selected T-EAS and, if\\nrequired, the selected T-EES, during ACR as described in clauses 8.8.2.4\\nand 8.8.2.5;\\n\\nNOTE: The T-EAS and T-EES information can be used to determine the PDU\\nsession(s) to provide connectivity to the T-EAS and the T-EES. If the\\nACR does not require change in EES, i.e. T-EES is same as S-EES, then\\nthe T-EES information can be skipped.\\n\\n- ACR complete events.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EEC has subscribed with the EES for the ACR information as\\nspecified in clause\\xa08.8.3.5.2.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.5.3-1: ACR information notification\\n\\n1. An event (e.g. ACR complete, or Target information notification)\\noccurs at the EES that satisfies trigger conditions for providing ACR\\ninformation to a subscribed EEC.\\n\\n2. The EES sends an ACR information notification to the EEC with the ACR\\ninformation determined in step 1. The ACR information notification may\\ninclude ACID to indicate the application context relocation of the AC is\\ncomplete. If the S-EES has received the successful EEC Context Push\\nresponse from T-EES, along with registration ID and the registration\\nexpiration time in the EEC Context Push relocation procedure, then the\\nACR information notification towards EEC also includes the registration\\nID and registration expiration time under EEC context relocation status\\n(for successful status). Upon receiving the target information\\nnotification to indicate start of the ACR execution, the EEC avoids\\ntriggering a second ACR execution for the same ACR identity (ACID, UE\\nID, S-EAS endpoint and T-EAS endpoint) until the current ACR execution\\nis completed.\\n\\nIf during the ACR the EES has received the successful EEC Context Push\\nresponse from the T-EES and the EEC Context Push response includes T-EES\\nselected ACR scenario list in the EEC Context Push relocation procedure,\\nthen the ACR information notification towards the EEC includes the list\\nfrom T-EES as the selected ACR scenario list under EEC context\\nrelocation status (for successful status). Upon receiving the ACR\\ncomplete notification, if the selected ACR scenario list is not\\navailable (for successful status), the EEC may either select ACR\\nscenario considering the supported ACR scenarios of AC, EEC, T-EES and\\nT-EAS or request T-EES to select list of ACR scenarios as specified in\\nclause\\xa08.15.\\n\\nAfter the ACR complete notification with successful ACR, if the ACR\\ncomplete notification indicates that EEC context relocation has failed\\nthe EEC can trigger EAS Information provisioning procedure to perform a\\nre-selection of the ACR scenarios.\\n\\nIf EEC context does not exist, after the ACR complete notification with\\nsuccessful ACR, the EEC can trigger EAS Information provisioning\\nprocedure to select the ACR scenarios.\\n\\n8.8.3.5.4 Subscription update\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.5.4-1 illustrates the ACR information subscription update\\nprocedure between the EEC and the EES.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1.

The EES sends an ACR information unsubscribe response to the EEC.\\n\\n8.8.3.6 EELManagedACR procedure\\n\\n8.8.3.6.1 General\\n\\nThis clause introduces a procedure for ACR performed by the Edge Enabler\\nServers.\\n\\nWhen S-EES receives a request for EELManagedACR from S-EAS, the S-EES\\nperforms the service operations for the service continuity including\\ndetecting the event which may trigger the ACR, making the ACR decision,\\ndiscovering the T-EAS, accessing and transferring the Application\\nContext to the T-EES/T-EAS, notifying the T-EAS about the available\\nApplication Context, notifying the 3GPP network about ACR information,\\nnotifying the EEC about the T-EAS information (as per EEC subscription).\\n\\nThe EELManagedACR procedure is designed as an asynchronous operation\\nwherein the S-EES will generate notifications (e.g. failure of any ACR\\nrelated operation) to the S-EAS while performing the ACR operations.\\n\\n8.8.3.6.2 Procedure\\n\\n8.8.3.6.2.1 General\\n\\nThis clause describes the procedures for S-EAS to request for\\nEELManagedACR and for T-EAS to subscribe for ACT status notification.\\n\\n8.8.3.6.2.2 ACR request\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.6.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure for EELManagedACR\\nperformed by the Edge Enabler Servers.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. Information related to the S-EES is available with the S-EAS.\\n\\n2. The T-EAS has subscribed to the ACR related event from the T-EES.\\n\\n3. The EEC has subscribed to the ACR related event from the S-EES.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.6.2.2-1: ACR procedure\\n\\n1. The S-EAS sends an EELManagedACR service request (UE identifier, EAS\\ncharacteristics for ACR) to request the S-EES to handle all the service\\noperations of the ACR. The S-EAS may initiate this request with S-EES\\nbased on different triggers (e.g. when Application Client is connecting\\nto the S-EAS). An address for accessing the Application Context may be\\nprovided if available, which allows the S-EES to access the Application\\nContext generated by the S-EAS for ACT.\\n\\n2. The S-EES checks whether the requesting EAS is authorized to perform\\nthe operation. If it is authorized, the S-EES responds with an\\nEELManagedACR service response. If no address for accessing Application\\nContext is provided by S-EAS in step\\xa01, then the S-EES provides an\\naddress for storing the Application Context by S-EAS.\\n\\nNOTE: How the EES accesses the Application Context related to the EAS\\nfrom the address of the Application Context storage is up to\\nimplementation and outside the scope of the present document.\\n\\n3. The S-EES determines the EELManagedACR operations to be executed as\\nspecified in clause\\xa08.8.2.5.\\n\\n8.8.3.6.2.3 ACT status subscription\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.6.2.3-1 illustrates the procedure for T-EAS to subscribe\\nfor ACT status during EELManagedACR.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.6.2.3-1: ACR procedure\\n\\n1. The T-EAS sends an ACT status subscription request to the T-EES.\\n\\n2. The T-EES checks whether the requesting T-EAS is authorized to\\nperform the operation. If it is authorized, the T-EES creates the\\nsubscription.\\n\\n3. The T-EES responds with the ACT status subscription response\\n\\n8.8.3.6.2.4 ACT status notification\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.6.2.4-1 illustrates the procedure for T-EES to notify the\\nT-EAS about the status of ACT during EELManagedACR.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. ACT between the S-EES and T-EES has been completed.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.6.2.4-1: ACR procedure\\n\\n1. The T-EES sends ACT status notification to the T-EAS, notifying about\\nthe status of the ACT between the Application Context received from the\\nS-EES.\\n\\n2. On receiving a notification about successful ACT, the T-EAS may\\ninitiate the ACR status update procedure as described in clause 8.8.3.8.\\n\\n8.8.3.7 Selected T-EAS declaration\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.7-1 illustrates the interactions between the S-EAS and the\\nS-EES for the selected T-EAS declaration.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The S-EAS has discovered and selected the T-EAS as described in\\nclause\\xa08.8.3.2.\\n\\n[]\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.7-1: Selected target EAS declaration procedure\\n\\n1. The S-EAS sends Selected target EAS declaration request message to\\nthe S-EES. The request includes the information of the selected T-EAS\\nand may include ACID to indicate which AC the T-EAS is intended for.\\n\\n2. The S-EES checks whether the requesting EAS is authorized to perform\\noperation. If authorized, the S-EES responds to the received request\\nwith Selected target EAS notification declaration response message. The\\nS-EES also determines the selected T-EES based on the declared T-EAS\\nselection, then S-EES checks whether the EEC (serving the ACs) has\\nsubscribed for ACR related information.\\n\\n8.8.3.8 ACR status update procedure\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.8-1 illustrates the procedure for ACR status update, which\\nis triggered by the S-EAS or the T-EAS. In the post-ACR clean up phase\\nof service continuity scenarios described in clause\\xa08.8.2, this\\nprocedure may be used by EAS to indicate the status of ACT to their\\nregistrar EESs; or used by the T-EAS to update the notification target\\naddress and allow the T-EES to indicate the status of EDGE-3\\nsubscription relocation to the T-EAS including subscription ID update\\nfor EDGE-3 subscriptions; or both.\\n\\nPre-condition:\\n\\n1. The ACT procedure between the S-EAS and the T-EAS is either\\nsuccessfully completed or failed.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.8-1: ACR status update procedure\\n\\n1. The EAS sends ACR status update request message to the EES, the\\nrequest may include the ACT result (success or failure). When sent by\\nthe T-EAS, the request may include a list of EDGE-3 subscription ID(s)\\nand Notification Target Address for which the T-EAS wants to update. In\\ncase of EELManagedACR, the ACT result is not included by the T-EAS.\\n\\n2. If the request is authorized by the EES, the EES processes the\\nrequest. When sent by the T-EAS, if the EDGE-3 subscriptions are\\navailable in the T-EES or were successfully relocated during the EEC\\ncontext relocation procedure, the T-EES updates the Notification Target\\nAddress if provided by the T-EAS and may update the list of EDGE-3\\nsubscription ID(s) for the EDGE-3 subscriptions.\\n\\nWhen the ACR status update request message of step 1 includes the ACT\\nresult, it shall also include the UEID and endpoint information of the\\nother EAS involved in the ACT. The EES uses UEID and EAS endpoint\\ninformation to identify the corresponding ACR. In cases where the ACT\\nresult indicates failure of the ACR (i.e. failure with a cause\\nindicating cancellation of the ACR), the T-EES which receives the ACR\\nstatus update request message removes the transferred EEC context.\\n\\n3. The EES responds with ACR status update response message to the\\nEAS.If the EEC context has been established and during the ACR the T-EES\\nhas provided the Selected ACR Scenario list to the S-EES as a result of\\na successful push context response as per clause 8.9.2.3, after the\\nsuccessful ACR the T-EES updates the Session Context IE within the EEC\\nContext in Table\\xa08.2.8-1 by replacing Selected ACR scenario list with\\nthe Selected ACR Scenario list in the push context response. The T-EES\\nmay send the ACR Selection notification to the T-EAS if the T-EAS has\\nsubscribed to such a notification.\\n\\nNOTE: If EES is not changed during ACR, the T-EES and S-EES are the same\\nserver.\\n\\n8.8.3.9 ACR parameter information procedure\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.9-1 illustrates the procedure for sending ACR parameters\\nfrom S-EES to the T-EES and T-EAS. The procedure may be used by the\\nS-EES at the beginning of the ACR execution to provide ACR parameters,\\ne.g. prediction expiration time, to the T-EES and T-EAS. The procedure\\nmay also be used during an ongoing ACR to update ACR parameters.\\n\\nPre-condition:\\n\\n1. The ACR has been launched to the S-EES.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.9-1: ACR parameter information procedure\\n\\n1. The S-EES sends the ACR parameter information request to the T-EES.\\n\\n2. The T-EES checks if the requestor is authorized for this operation.\\nIf authorized, the T-EES processes the request.\\n\\n3. If the request is authorized and if the T-EAS has subscribed to\\nreceive ACR notifications, the EES shall notify the T-EAS by sending an\\nACR management notification, with \"ACT start\" event including ACR\\nparameters from the request in step 1, e.g. Prediction expiration time.\\n\\n4. In case of service continuity planning, if the T-EAS had included\\nindication of EAS Acknowledgement within ACR management subscribe\\nrequest, the T-EAS sends EAS Acknowledgement as a response to the ACR\\nmanagement notification. In the Acknowledgement, the T-EAS indicates the\\nacceptance or rejection of the ACT considering ACR parameters (e.g.\\nprediction expiration time).\\n\\nNOTE: The T-EAS can use the ACR parameters to handle the ACR. For\\nexample, the T-EAS can consider prediction expiration time in deciding\\nwhether and for how long to wait for the AC of the UE to connect to it.\\nIf the ACT is performed, and the AC does not connect to the T-EAS by\\n\"Prediction expiration time\", the EAS can send ACT failure with the\\nappropriate cause to the EES. In that case, the T-EAS can delete the\\ntransferred application context.\\n\\n5. The EES responds to the requestor\\'s request with an ACR parameter\\ninformation response message.\\n\\n8.8.3.10 Selected EES declaration\\n\\nThe selected EES declaration request is triggered when an ACR is\\nperformed from EAS to CAS.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.8.3.10-1 illustrates the interactions between the EES and the\\nCAS for the selected EES declaration.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. A serving EES is selected for the EEC and the serving EES decides to\\ninform CAS. The serving EES is the last EES serving the EEC during the\\nACR from EAS to CAS.\\n\\n2.

The EEC Context may include\\ninformation about the EEC-hosting UE and the ACs to which the EEC\\nprovides services. The EEC Context information may be collected and\\nmaintained at the EES in an EDN while the respective ACs are connected\\nto EASs in that EDN.\\n\\nEEC Context relocation procedures allow the EEC Context information to\\nbe shared between EESs (via EDGE-9 interactions).\\n\\nThe EEC Context information may contain List of EDGE-1 subscriptions\\n(i.e., list of subscription IDs for an EEC). The corresponding EDGE-1\\nsubscription information includes EEC ID, Event ID, subscription ID,\\n3GPP CN subscription information (optional), notification target address\\n(optional) and filter information (optional).\\n\\n8.9.1.1 EEC Context handling at EEC registration\\n\\nAn EEC Context shall be created for each registered EEC, after a\\nsuccessful registration, by the receiver EES, as follows:\\n\\n- If the EEC registration request does not include a previously assigned\\nEEC Context ID value, the receiver EES creates an EEC Context as\\ndescribed in clause\\xa08.2.8. The receiver EES shall assign an EEC context\\nID and set the source EES Endpoint to its own Endpoint. The EEC ID and\\nUE Identifier shall be set based on the corresponding registration\\nrequest parameters.\\n\\n- If the EEC registration request contains an EEC context ID and source\\nEES Endpoint, the receiver (i.e., target) EES performs an EEC Context\\nPull relocation (clause\\xa08.9.2.2). After a successful EEC Context\\nrelocation, the target EES updates the source EES Endpoint with its own\\nEndpoint. The target EES may preserve the EEC Context ID received in the\\nrequest or assign a new EEC Context ID, subject to EES implementation\\nand local policies.\\n\\nIf the EEC Context relocation is not successful, the target EES creates\\nan EEC Context as described in clause\\xa08.2.8. The target EES shall assign\\nan EEC context ID and set the source EES Endpoint to its own endpoint.\\nThe EEC ID and UE ID shall be set based on the corresponding\\nregistration request parameters.\\n\\nAfter a successful EEC Context Relocation procedure is performed at EEC\\n(re-)registration to a target EES, the source EES shall determine to be\\nstale the EEC Context identified by the EEC Context ID included in the\\nrequest (i.e., relocated) and the EEC to be de-registered.\\n\\n8.9.1.2 EEC Context handling at EEC registration update\\n\\nAn EEC Context shall be updated when EEC Registration update requests\\ntargeting the corresponding EEC ID are received.\\n\\n8.9.1.3 EEC Context handling at EEC de-registration\\n\\nAn EEC Context, including the list of Service Session Context(s)\\ninformation, shall be determined to be stale after a successful EEC\\nde-registration procedure.\\n\\nNOTE: Stale EEC Context(s) are subject to information persistence\\npolicies and privacy policies. Mechanisms for re-use of stale EEC\\nContext(s) are not in scope of the current version of specification.\\n\\n8.9.1.4 EEC Context handling at Application Context Relocation\\n\\nThe EEC Context provided to a target EES in an EEC Context Pull\\nrelocation or an EEC context Push relocation shall be stored at the\\ntarget EES, as follows:\\n\\n- If an EEC context with the same EEC ID, EEC Context ID and source\\nEndpoint already exists at the target EES, the EEC Context is updated.\\n\\n- If an EEC context with the same EEC ID, EEC Context ID and source\\nEndpoint does not exist at the target EES, the EEC Context is stored.\\n\\nAfter a successful EEC Context Relocation procedure is performed at ACR,\\nthe source EES shall determine to be stale the element(s) of the list of\\nService Session Context(s) information included in the request (i.e.,\\nrelocated). If all Service Session Context(s) information in the EEC\\nContext are stale, the EEC Context is determined to be stale and the EEC\\nto be de-registered.\\n\\n8.9.1.5 Other EEC Context handling \\n\\nElements of the list of Service Session Context(s) information shall be\\ncreated by the EES when it determines that a registered EAS is providing\\nservices to an AC on the served EEC.\\n\\nElements of the list of Service Session Context(s) information shall be\\ndetermined to be stale when the EES determines that a registered EAS is\\nno longer providing services to an AC on the served EEC.\\n\\nNOTE: In this version of specification, mechanisms used by EES to\\ndetermine that a registered EAS is no longer providing services to an AC\\non a served EEC are implementation-dependent.\\n\\nAn EEC Context shall be updated as follows:\\n\\n- When EEC Context(s) are created, either after a registration request\\nor based on EEC Context relocation procedure, the EES shall check\\nwhether the UE Identifier corresponds to an existing EEC Context and\\nupdate the EEC Context accordingly.\\n\\n- When EEC subscription requests corresponding to the EEC ID are\\nprocessed, the \"List of EDGE-1 subscriptions\" shall be updated\\naccordingly\\n\\n8.9.2 Procedures\\n\\n8.9.2.1 General\\n\\nThe following procedures are supported for EEC Context relocation:\\n\\n- EEC Context Push; and\\n\\n- EEC Context Pull.\\n\\n8.9.2.2 EEC Context Pull relocation\\n\\nAn EEC Context is relocated via an EEC Context Pull request initiated by\\nthe target EES.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.9.2.2-1 illustrates the EEC Context Pull.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The source EES has provided the EEC with an EEC Context ID; and\\n\\n2. The target EES has received the EEC Context ID, source EES Endpoint.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.9.2.2-1: EEC Context Pull procedure\\n\\n1. The target EES requests an EEC Context from the source EES. The\\nrequest includes EEC Context ID.\\n\\n2. Upon receiving the request from the target EES, the source EES\\nvalidates the request and verifies the security credentials of the\\nrequester. The source EES uses the EEC Context ID provided to identify\\nand authorize the EEC Context to be relocated.\\n\\n3. The source EES sends a successful EEC Context response. The target\\nEES stores the received EEC Context.\\n\\n8.9.2.3 EEC Context Push relocation\\n\\nAn EEC Context is relocated via an EEC Context Push request initiated by\\nthe source EES.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The source EES has provided the EEC with an EEC Context ID.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.9.2.3-2: EEC Context relocation procedure initiated by source\\nEES\\n\\n1. The source EES determines to forward EEC Context for relocation to a\\ntarget EES. The source EES determines the target and the EEC Context to\\nbe forwarded.\\n\\n2. The source EES sends EEC Context Push request to the target EES\\nincluding the EEC Context determined.\\n\\n3. Upon receiving the request from the source EES, the target EES\\nvalidates the request and verifies the security credentials. The target\\nEES uses the EEC Context ID provided to authorize the EEC Context to be\\nstored and managed. Then the target EES sends an EEC Context response\\nindicating success. The T-EES performs implicit registration and creates\\nthe registration ID for the registration and includes it in the EEC\\ncontext push response message for S-EAS decided ACR or S-EES executed\\nACR scenarios. The S-EES stores the registration details, and when\\nrequired, notifies the EEC about registration details while sending ACR\\ninformation notification.\\n\\nIf the request in step 2 includes the list of selected ACR scenarios\\nwithin the EEC context, and if the list cannot be supported by T-EES or\\nT-EAS, new list of selected ACR scenarios needs to be selected based on\\nthe request from S-EES. The T-EES selects a list of selected ACR\\nscenarios based on T-EES and T-EAS capabilities and \"EEC Service\\nContinuity Support\" if the IE has been provided in the EEC context and\\nincludes it in the Push EEC context response.\\n\\nNOTE: In this release, ACR scenario list transfer is not supported if\\nEEC is not registered. The EEC can perform EEC Context establishment and\\nACR scenario selection with the target EES.\\n\\n8.9.3 Information flows\\n\\n8.9.3.1 General\\n\\nThe following information flows are specified for

Alternatively, when an EES is acting on\\nbehalf of an EAS that is also considered an AF, the EES may pass the\\nEASID as the AF identifier in place of its EESID if it is authorized to\\ndo so.\\n\\n8.11 EEC Authentication/Authorization \\n\\n8.11.1 General\\n\\nThe architecture for enabling edge applications supports EEC\\nauthentication/authorization.\\n\\nAfter the successful EEC authentication/authorization, the EEC acquires\\na valid security credential for EEC related procedures including service\\nprovisioning procedure, EEC registration procedure, EAS discovery\\nprocedure and ACR procedure. Detailed procedures are specified in\\n3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa033.558\\xa0[23].\\n\\n8.12 Dynamic EAS instantiation triggering\\n\\n8.12.1 General\\n\\nThe EES may trigger the EAS instantiation dynamically due to e.g., EAS\\ndiscovery request, EAS discovery subscription request, UE mobility, upon\\nreceiving EEC Registration request containing AC profile or upon\\nreceiving an EAS information provisioning request.\\n\\nUpon receiving the EAS discovery request with EAS discovery filter from\\nthe EEC or the S-EES during the procedures for EAS discovery or ACR, the\\nEES may fail to discover and select the EAS that matches the UE location\\nand the requesting application characteristics specified in\\ntable\\xa08.5.3.2-2 due to no EAS is available or instantiated. The EES may\\ntrigger the ECSP management system (which is specified in TS 28.538\\n[22]) to instantiate the EAS serving the AC in the EDN corresponding to\\nthe EAS that can be instantiable before returning the EAS information to\\nthe EEC or S-EES, based on the information about instantiable EASs which\\ncan be dynamically instantiated at the associated EDN. If EAS selection\\nis performed by the EES, the selected EAS is dynamically instantiated if\\napplicable.\\n\\nBased on the information about instantiable EASs, the EES may maintain\\nthe EAS instantiation status transition (e.g., among instantiated,\\ninstantiable but not instantiated yet, or instantiation in progress) via\\nthe EAS (de-)registration procedure or the dynamic EAS instantiation\\ntriggering procedure. The EAS instantiation status can be provided to\\nthe EEC using the Instantiable EAS Information IE of EAS discovery\\nresponse and EAS discovery notification for the use of EAS selection by\\nthe EEC. If the EEC indicates EAS Instantiation Triggering Suppress in\\nEAS discovery request and EAS discovery subscription request, then the\\nEES does not trigger EAS instantiation.\\n\\nUpon receiving EEC Registration request with bundle EAS information the\\nEES may determine that only a subset of the EAS(s) in the bundle are\\nregistered and instantiated. If only a subset of bundle EASs is\\ndetermined, the EES may trigger the ECSP management system to\\ninstantiate the subset of remaining EASs corresponding to the bundle\\nthat can be instantiable before responding to the registration request.\\n\\nUpon receiving one or more EAS discovery subscription request(s) for the\\navailability of an EAS, EES may determine if there is a need for EAS\\ninstantiation based on the information about instantiable EASs. If such\\na need for EAS instantiation determined, EES may send a report for a\\nneed of the EAS instantiation to the ECSP management system to consider\\ninstantiating the requested EAS by invoking an MnS API of the ECSP\\nmanagement system. When the requested EAS has been instantiated, the EES\\nmay obtain the EAS profile during the EAS registration procedure and\\nnotify the availability change event of the requested EAS with the EAS\\nprofile to the corresponding EECs via the EAS discovery notification\\nprocedure as specified in the clause 8.5.2.3.\\n\\nUpon receiving the EAS information provisioning request, the EES may\\ntrigger the ECSP management system to instantiate the EAS in the EDN\\nbefore returning the EAS information to the EEC.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa01: The ECSP management system is responsible for the authorization\\nof the dynamic EAS instantiation.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa02: The ECSP management system can provide the information about\\ninstantiable EASs to the EES. Such a mechanism is out of scope of this\\nrelease of the present document.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa03: When determining a need for EAS instantiation, EES can further\\nconsider the requested service characteristics (e.g. location, latency)\\nby EEC or service load/capacity (e.g. number of service sessions) of\\nEAS, which is upon implementation and out the scope of this\\nspecification.\\n\\nEditor\\'s note: The MnS APIs for EAS instantiation request/notification\\nshould be provided by the ECSP management system, which is the scope of\\nSA5.\\n\\n8.13 Charging\\n\\n  The charging procedures are specified in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa032.257\\xa0[25].\\n\\n8.14 EDGE-5 APIs\\n\\n8.14.1 General\\n\\nEEC exposes EDGE-5 APIs corresponding to EEC\\'s capabilities, for the AC\\nto request EEC\\'s services for edge enablement. Using these APIs, ACs\\nrequest the EEC for EEL services. EDGE-5 APIs include one-time\\nrequest/response operations for EAS discovery, retrieval of UE ID and\\nACR operations. Additionally, the AC can request for an AC subscription.\\nThe EEC creates the subscription and when required, performs necessary\\noperations such as EAS discovery, ACR etc., delivering notifications to\\nthe AC as required.\\n\\nNOTE: EEC can initiate any EDGE-1 or EDGE-4 operation without receiving\\na request or without receiving AC related information from the AC.\\n\\nEditor\\'s note: [SA3] How to ensure of user\\'s authorization/consent as\\nwell as AC’s authorization in invoking functions exposed by EEC (to AC)\\nwhich in turn relies on functions exposed by the network (e.g. Location)\\nvia EES/NEF is SA3’s responsibility.\\n\\n8.14.2 Procedures\\n\\n8.14.2.1 General\\n\\nFollowing procedures are specified for EDGE-5:\\n\\n- Registration;\\n\\n- EAS discovery;\\n\\n- ACR trigger request;\\n\\n- EEC services subscription; and\\n\\n- UE ID request.\\n\\n8.14.2.2 Registration\\n\\n8.14.2.2.1 General\\n\\nFollowing are supported for AC registration:\\n\\n- AC registration procedure;\\n\\n- AC registration update procedure; and\\n\\n- AC de-registration procedure.\\n\\n8.14.2.2.2 AC registration \\n\\nFigure\\xa08.14.2.2.2-1 illustrates AC registration procedure.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. AC can communicate with the EEC.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.14.2.2.2-1: AC registration procedure\\n\\n1. The AC sends an AC registration request to the EEC. The request\\nincludes the AC profile, AC\\'s security credentials and optionally the\\nEAS characteristics. The request may also include a list of EEC\\'s\\nservices that AC requires the EEC to handle. The request additionally\\nincludes ECS configuration information if the AC is edge-aware and\\nconfigured with the ECS configuration information.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa01: The ASP providing the AC and the ECSP providing the ECS can have\\nedge computing service provider service agreement as described in Annex\\nB. The ECS configuration information configured in the AC is based on\\nthe service agreement.\\n\\n2. The EEC checks AC\\'s security credentials and validates the request.\\n\\n3. If the request is successfully validated, the EEC registers the\\ninformation provided in the request and responds back to the AC with AC\\nregistration response. The AC registration response includes the list of\\nEEC\\'s services that AC is authorized for.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa02: The mechanisms used for authentication and authorization between\\nAC and EEC is out of scope of this specification. EEC can use local\\npolicies, user preferences, ASP services agreement(s) (see Annex\\xa0B) to\\nauthorize the request from the AC.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa03: When the ECS configuration information is provided from an AC,\\nthe EEC can use the ECS configuration for initial service provisioning\\nfor the AC that provided the ECS configuration information if there is\\nno ECS configuration information is provided from the 5GC.\\n\\n8.14.2.2.3 AC registration update\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.14.2.2.3-1 illustrates AC registration update procedure.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. AC is registered with the EEC.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.14.2.2.3-1: AC registration update procedure\\n\\n1. The AC sends an AC registration update request to the EEC. The\\nrequest includes the registration ID, AC\\'s security credentials, and may\\ninclude the updated AC profile, EAS discovery filters, list of requested\\nEEC services and list of ECS information.\\n\\n2. The EEC checks AC\\'s security credentials and validates the request.\\n\\n3. If the request is successfully validated, the EEC sends a successful\\nregistration update response, which includes an updated list of EEC\\nservices that AC is authorized for.\\n\\n8.14.2.2.4 AC deregistration\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.14.2.2.4-1 illustrates AC deregistration procedure.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. AC is registered with the EEC.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.14.2.2.4-1: AC deregistration procedure\\n\\n1. The AC sends an AC deregistration request to the EEC. The request\\nincludes the registration ID and AC\\'s security credentials.\\n\\n2. The EEC checks AC\\'s security credentials and validates the request.\\n\\n3. Upon successful authorization, the EEC deregisters the AC and sends a\\nsuccessful de-registration response.\\n\\n8.14.2.3 EAS discovery\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The AC can communicate with the EEC.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.14.2.3-1: EAS discovery request procedure\\n\\n1. The AC sends an EAS discovery request to the EEC. The request\\nincludes AC profile and AC\\'s security credentials and may include EAS\\ndiscovery filters.\\n\\n2. The EEC checks AC\\'s security credentials and validates the request.\\n\\n3. If the request is successfully validated, the EEC determines if the\\nrequired EAS is available or not. The EEC may use information cached or\\npreconfigured at the EEC or may use the EAS discovery procedures to\\nquery the EES. If step 1 includes the AC profile or EAS discovery\\nfilters, then the EEC may utilize the provided AC profile and filters,\\nto form the EAS discovery request towards EES. If step 1 does not\\ninclude any of the optional IEs of the AC profile and EAS discovery\\nfilters, and AC registration was performed, the EEC may utilize the AC\\nprofile provided by the AC during AC registration. The EEC also needs to\\ntake user privacy requirements, e.g., regarding the disclosure of\\nlocation information towards the network into account. If required,\\ne.g., when EAS discovery procedures returns a list of EASs, the EEC\\nperforms EAS selection based on the information received in step 1 and\\nthe AC profile. The EEC can perform EAS discovery with different EESs\\nbefore selecting an EAS.\\n\\nEditor\\'s note: SA3 recommendations, if any, on how the user or the AC\\ncan consent, e.g., to the disclosure of location information and the use\\nof the AC ID in the signalling towards the network are FFS.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa01: If required, the EEC can perform service provisioning procedure,\\nor EEC registration procedure or both, before performing the EAS\\ndiscovery procedures. EEC may already have captured EESs and EASs\\navailability for present location; so that the AC\\'s request (step 1) can\\nbe replied to quickly and efficiently.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa02: The EEC can include AC profiles of more than one AC in the EAS\\ndiscovery request sent to the EES.\\n\\n4. The EEC responds back to the AC with the EAS discovery response. The\\nresponse includes the EAS profile(s) of the available EAS(s).\\n\\n8.14.2.4 ACR trigger request\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. AC has subscribed for \"ACR notifications\" as specified in clause\\n8.14.2.5.2.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.14.2.4-1: ACR trigger request procedure\\n\\n1. The AC sends an ACR trigger request to the EEC. The request includes\\nAC profile, AC\\'s security credentials, type of requested operation\\n(i.e., ACR detection, ACR initiation) and S-EAS information as described\\nin clause\\xa08.14.3.10. If the request is to initiate the ACR, the request\\nmay also include the target EAS information.\\n\\n2. The EEC checks AC\\'s security credentials and validates the request.\\n\\n3. If the request is successfully validated, the EEC sends an ACR\\ntrigger response to the AC indicating if the request was successful as\\ndescribed in 8.14.3.11. The EEC process the request from the AC. If the\\ntype of requested operation in the request received in step 1 is:\\n\\n- ACR detection, then the EEC determines if ACR is required or not. If\\nit is required, the EEC uses one of the EEC initiated ACR scenarios or\\nlaunches ACR with action \"determination\", leading to S-EES executed ACR;\\n\\n- ACR initiation, then the EEC uses one of the EEC initiated ACR\\nscenarios and initiate ACR. If the request in step 1 also includes\\ntarget information, the EEC uses it to select the ACR targets;\\n\\nNOTE: EEC notifies the AC to trigger ACT as required, or EEC notifies\\nACR execution result as specified in clause\\xa08.14.2.5.3.\\n\\n8.14.2.5 EEC services subscription\\n\\n8.14.2.5.1 General\\n\\nFollowing are supported for EEC services subscription:\\n\\n- Subscribe;\\n\\n- Notify;\\n\\n- Subscription update; and\\n\\n- Unsubscribe.\\n\\n8.14.2.5.2 Subscribe\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The AC can communicate with the EEC.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.14.2.5.2-1: EEC services subscription procedure\\n\\n1. The AC sends an EEC services subscription request to the EEC. The\\nrequest includes AC profile, AC\\'s security credentials, a list of EEC\\'s\\nservices that AC requires the EEC to handle, and related parameters as\\ndescribed in 8.14.3.12. If the subscription request includes:\\n\\n- EAS discovery or EAS dynamic information subscription, then the\\nrequest may include a list of EAS characteristics and a list of EAS\\ndynamic information filters respectively;\\n\\n- ACR, then the request includes a list of S-EAS information and\\ncorresponding type of ACR operations:\\n\\n- ACR notifications, where the EEC notifies the AC with respect to the\\n\"ACR detection\" and \"ACR initiation\" requests as specified in\\nclause\\xa08.14.2.5.3;\\n\\n- ACR monitoring, where the EEC monitors the need for ACR and notifies\\nthe AC as and when required e.g., on receiving ACR related notifications\\non EDGE-1 interface; and\\n\\n- EEC managed ACR, where the EEC monitors the need for ACR. If need for\\nACR is detected, then the EEC decides and initiates ACR using one of the\\nEEC initiated ACR scenarios. The EEC notifies the AC about the imminent\\nACR and may include the target information.\\n\\n2. The EEC checks AC\\'s security credentials and validates the request.\\n\\n3. If the request is successfully validated, the EEC creates the\\nsubscription and sends an EEC services subscription response message to\\nthe AC. The response includes the list of services that the EEC will\\nhandle and related details.\\n\\n4. The EEC executes the services e.g., EAS discovery, ACR, and notifies\\nthe AC with information as necessary. The EEC may use locally cached\\ninformation or configurations while providing services to the AC.\\n\\n8.14.2.5.3 EEC services notification\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The AC has subscribed to the EEC.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.14.2.5.3-1: EEC services notification procedure\\n\\n1. An event occurs at the EEC that satisfies the trigger conditions for\\nnotifying a AC e.g., EEC detects a need for Application Context\\nRelocation, unavailability of suitable T-EES and/or unavailability of\\nsuitable T-EAS.\\n\\nNOTE: Upon receiving a EEC services notification indicating no suitable\\nT-EES/T-EAS was available, the AC may decide to move the application\\ncontext to the CAS\\n\\n2. The EEC sends an EEC services notification to the AC with relevant\\ninformation related to the event triggered in step 1.\\n\\n8.14.2.5.4 EEC services subscription update\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.14.2.5.4-1 illustrates EEC services subscription update\\nprocedure.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The AC has subscribed to the EEC.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.14.2.5.4-1: EEC services subscription update procedure\\n\\n1. The AC sends an EEC services subscription update request to the EEC.\\nThe request includes the subscription ID, AC\\'s security credentials, and\\nmay include updated notification related details or updated list of\\nrequired EEC services.\\n\\n2. The EEC checks AC\\'s security credentials and validates the request.\\n\\n3. If the request is successfully validated, the EEC updates the\\nsubscription and sends a successful subscription update response.\\n\\n4. The EEC executes the services e.g., EAS discovery, ACR, and notifies\\nthe AC with information as necessary. The EEC may use locally cached\\ninformation or configurations while providing services to the AC.\\n\\n8.14.2.5.5 Unsubscribe\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.14.2.5.5-1 illustrates the unsubscribe procedure.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The AC has subscribed to the EEC.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.14.2.5.5-1: EEC services unsubscribe procedure\\n\\n1. The AC sends EEC services unsubscribe request to the EEC. The request\\nincludes the subscription ID and AC\\'s security credentials.\\n\\n2. The EEC checks AC\\'s security credentials and validates the request.\\n\\n3. Upon successful authorization, the EEC sends a successful\\nde-registration response.\\n\\n8.14.2.6 UE ID request\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The AC can communicate with the EEC.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.14.2.6-1: UE ID request procedure\\n\\n1. The AC sends an UE ID request to the EEC. The request includes AC\\'s\\nsecurity credentials and the EAS ID list for which the AC needs to know\\nthe associated Edge UE ID or AF-specific UE ID(s).\\n\\n2. The EEC checks AC\\'s security credentials and validates the request.\\n\\n3. If the request is successfully validated, the EEC process the request\\nfrom the AC. The EEC uses the UE Identifier API procedure (see clause\\n8.6.5) to query the EES.\\n\\nNOTE: This procedure may be used to support the retrieval of the UE ID\\nfor AC’s (and EAS\\'s) dealing with IPv4 NATed IP address issue (i.e.\\nEAS\\'s direct invocation of UE Identifier API procedure due to NATed IP\\naddress fails to identify the UE).

information provisioning procedure allows the EEC to exchange\\ninformation with the EES about selected EAS and/or ACR scenario\\nselection.\\n\\nWhen service continuity is required, ACR scenarios may be combined to\\nperform ACR detection in one or more of the EEC, the EES and the EAS;\\nthe related procedures are specified in clauses 8.15.2, 8.6.3 and\\nreferred to in clause 8.8.2. The selection of ACR scenario(s) may be\\nperformed by the EEC or the EES for a given AC and the selected EAS from\\nthe common supported ACR scenarios of AC, EEC, selected EES and selected\\nEAS. The selection of ACR scenario(s) for each EAS in EAS bundles may be\\nperformed separately by the EEC or the EES (or the main EES in case of\\nbundle EAS served by multiple EESs, which is the EES registering the\\nmain EAS) for a given AC and the selected EAS(s) in a bundle, based on\\nthe service continuity support by AC, EEC, EES(s) and EAS(s). In\\naddition, the EEC or EES can further determine the one or more ACR\\nscenario(s) for the selected EAS based on the AC service KPI.\\n\\nNOTE: How to select ACR scenario(s) at the EEC or EES considering AC\\nservice KPI is implementation specific.\\n\\nInstantiable EAS Information may be provided to the EEC in EAS discovery\\nresponse and EAS discovery notification, as specified in clause 8.5.3.3\\nand 8.5.3.6. Triggering the instantiation of an EAS by the EEC may be\\nannounced to the EES by including the selected EASID in the EAS\\ninformation provisioning request without including the selected EAS\\nendpoint.\\n\\nThe EAS information provisioning request types supported are:\\n\\n- \"ACR scenario selection announcement\". Inform the EES about the EAS\\nthat has been selected by the EEC and may provide the selected ACR\\nscenario list to the EES. For the EAS bundles scenario, the selected\\nbundled EAS(s) and the selected ACR scenario list for EAS bundles by EEC\\nare included and notified to the EES.\\n\\n- \"ACR scenario selection request\". Inform the EES to perform ACR\\nscenario selection. For the EAS bundles scenario, the request may inform\\nthe EES to determine the ACR scenario list for EAS bundles.\\n\\n- \"EAS selection request\". Inform the EES of EAS selection, e.g. for\\nApplication Group.\\n\\n8.15.2 Procedure\\n\\n8.15.2.1 General\\n\\n8.15.2.2 EAS Information provisioning\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The EEC has performed service provisioning procedure\\n\\n2. The EEC has performed the EAS discovery procedure\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.15.2.2-1: EAS information provisioning\\n\\n1. The EEC sends the EAS information provisioning request to the EES:\\n\\n  a- \"ACR scenario selection announcement\". The request may include ACR\\n  scenario list selected by the EEC, EEC security credentials, selected\\n  EASID, selected EAS endpoint, EECID and ACID. For the EAS bundles\\n  scenario, the request may include the ACR scenario list for EAS\\n  bundles selected by the EEC.\\n\\n  b- \"ACR scenario selection request\". The request may include AC\\n  profile, EEC service continuity support, EEC security credentials,\\n  EECID and ACID.\\n\\n  c- \" EAS selection\". Informs the EES of EAS selection. When\\n  Application Group information is included in the request, the EAS\\n  provided is considered Common EAS for Application Group.\\n\\n  The EAS information provisioning request may include associated EES(s)\\n  endpoint and the DNAIs and service area of the selected EAS(s).\\n\\nNOTE\\xa01: It is up to implementation how it is determined that EES no\\nlonger serves the application group.\\n\\nIf the EEC has selected an EAS which is instantiable but not yet\\ninstantiated, the EEC includes the selected EASID without including the\\nselected EAS endpoint in the request.\\n\\nThe request may contain the associated EES(s) information along with the\\nbundle EAS information (i.e. list of EASID) and the bundle EAS type\\nindicating direct bundle, each associated EES(s) is along with part of\\nor all the list of EASID, when EEC determines the associated EES(s)\\nbased on the EDN configuration information and bundle EAS information\\n(e.g. list of EASID and direct bundle type).\\n\\n2. Upon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES validates the EEC\\ninformation request and verifies if the EEC is authorized for this\\noperation.\\n\\n  a- \"ACR scenario selection announcement\". The EES may send the ACR\\n  Selection notification to the selected EAS if the EAS has subscribed\\n  and if EES allows EEC based ACR scenario selection. Otherwise, EES may\\n  respond with status failure and include appropriate reason. For the\\n  EAS bundles scenario, the EES may send the ACR selection notification\\n  to the bundled EAS(s).\\n\\n  b- \"ACR scenario selection request\". The EES selects the ACR scenario\\n  list and may send the ACR Selection notification to the selected EAS\\n  if the EAS has subscribed. The EES may include the ACR scenario list\\n  in the EAS information provisioning response. For the EAS bundles\\n  scenario, the EES selects the ACR scenario list for EAS bundles based\\n  on the AC/EEC/EES(s)/EAS(s) service continuity support, and sends the\\n  ACR scenario list to the bundled EAS(s).\\n\\n  c- \"EAS selection\". When Application Group information is not\\n  provided, the EES determines that the EAS in the request is providing\\n  services to the AC with the indicated ACID e.g. for EEC Context\\n  handling purposes as described in clause\\xa08.9. When Application Group\\n  information is included in the request, the EAS provided is considered\\n  Common EAS for the Application Group.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa02: Further clarification for EAS selection may be needed.\\n\\nIf the EEC or EES selected ACR scenario list for EAS bundle includes EAS\\nexecuted ACR scenario (as described in 8.8.2.8), the EES also sends\\nDNAIs and service area of the selected EAS(s) to the main EAS in the ACR\\nselection notification.\\n\\nThe request may contain the associated EES(s) information along with the\\nbundle EAS information (i.e. list of EASID) and the bundle EAS type\\nindicating direct bundle, each associated EES(s) is along with part of\\nor all the list of EASID, when EEC determines the associated EES(s)\\nbased on the EDN configuration information and bundle EAS information\\n(e.g. list of EASID and direct bundle type).\\n\\nIf the request contains selected EAS ID and selected EAS Endpoint, the\\nEES may apply the EAS traffic influence with the N6 routing information\\nof the EAS in the 3GPP Core Network, based on application KPIs and if\\nthe EAS traffic influence was not done before (e.g. neither in EAS\\ndiscovery procedure nor the EAS perform traffic influence).\\n\\nWhen the selection is that of a common EAS for application group, the\\nrequest message may contain the list of EESs for a certain Application\\nGroup ID, received from the ECS in the service provisioning response\\nmessage. This application group related information may be used for\\nfurther common EAS announcement(s) between EES(s). In the case of no\\nECS-ER, if the request message does not contain the list of EESs for a\\ncertain Application Group ID, then the EES determines the other EESs to\\nwhich announce common EAS request needs to be sent as described in\\nclause 8.8.3.3. If there is ECS-ER, the EEC selected EAS is used in\\ninteraction between the EES and ECS-ER, as described in clause\\xa08.20.2.3\\nto store the common EAS information., If the ECS-ER provides a different\\ncommon EAS information in the response it is forwarded to the EEC in the\\nEAS information provisioning response. If the ECS-ER-provided common EAS\\nis registered to another EES, then the EES endpoint of the EES where the\\ncommon EAS is registered is also included in the EAS information\\nprovisioning response.\\n\\nIf the request contains the selected EASID and the selected EAS endpoint\\nis not included, the EES verifies if instantiation of EAS is needed and\\nmay trigger the ECSP management system to instantiate the EAS as in\\nclause 8.12.\\n\\nWhen the request contains EEC Service Continuity Support IE and the EEC\\ncontext has been established, the EES includes the IE into the EEC\\ncontext described in Table 8.2.8-1.\\n\\n  NOTE\\xa02: EES can also influence the EAS traffic in advance.\\n\\n  NOTE\\xa03: It is up to the AC to decide when to connect to the selected\\n  EAS (either immediately or wait for a while) once the AC knows the\\n  selected EAS.\\n\\n3. If the processing of the request was successful, the EES sends an EAS\\ninformation provisioning response to the EEC indicating a successful\\nstatus. If an EEC context has been established, the response also\\nincludes the list of selected ACR scenario(s) into the session context\\nIE within EEC context as described in Table 8.2.8-2; otherwise, the EES\\nshall indicate a failure status and include appropriate reasons. If the\\nEES has triggered EAS instantiation based on the EAS information\\nprovisioning request and obtained the newly instantiated EAS\\ninformation, the response contains information about the newly\\ninstantiated EAS, including the EAS endpoint information.\\n\\n  The EEC, EES and EAS (or the bundled EAS(s)) use the selected ACR\\n  scenario list to determine if they should perform ACR detection and/or\\n  ACR decision.\\n\\n  Upon receiving the EAS information provisioning response, if the\\n  response includes instantiated EAS information, the EEC uses the\\n  endpoint information to subscribe to ACR event notification, as\\n  needed, and provides necessary notifications to the AC.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa04: Other ACR selection criteria are out of scope of the current\\nspecification.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa05: The common supported ACR scenarios is decided as part of the EAS\\ndiscovery and selection procedure.\\n\\nFor the \"EAS selection\" case, in the case of no ECS-ER, the selected\\ncommon EAS shall be announced to other relevant EES(s) as per procedure\\nin clause 8.19.\\n\\n8.15.3 Information flows\\n\\n8.15.3.1 General\\n\\nThe information flows are specified for EAS information provisioning\\nrequest and response.\\n\\n8.15.3.2 EAS information provisioning request\\n\\nTable 8.15.3.2-1 describes the information elements for EAS information\\nprovisioning request from the EEC to the EES.\\n\\nTable\\xa08.15.3.2-1: EAS information provisioning

The\\nECS can use it to trigger the EEC to initiate service provisioning\\nrequest (as per clause 8.3.3.2.2) when the EDN configuration information\\nin the ECS is updated. The EES can use it to trigger the EEC to initiate\\nEAS discovery request (as per clause 8.5.2.2) when the EAS profile in\\nthe EES is updated.\\n\\n  Editor\\'s note: It is FFS whether and how the ECS and EES determine the\\n  parameters (e.g., port ID) necessary for EEC triggering service or if\\n  configuration is sufficient.\\n\\nAfter receiving the EEC triggering indication in the Service\\nProvisioning subscription or EAS discovery subscription request as\\ndescribed in clause 8.3.3 and 8.5.2, when ECS or EES performs EEC\\ntriggering service by invoking the application triggering service, the\\nECS or EES includes, in the Trigger Payload, Triggering Entity\\nInformation (identifier and endpoint address of the triggering EES or\\nECS) and optionally Trigger Description, which indicates the procedure\\n(e.g., service provisioning or EAS discovery) to be initiated by the\\nEEC. Upon receiving the Trigger Payload, the EEC selects which procedure\\nneeds to be performed according to the received Trigger Description and\\ninitiates the selected procedure towards either EES or ECS indicated by\\nthe Triggering Entity Information in the Trigger Payload.\\n\\nNOTE: If the Trigger Description is not given, application port\\ninformation can be used by the EEC to select the procedure to be\\ntriggered.\\n\\n8.17 Support for roaming and federation\\n\\n8.17.1 General\\n\\nThis clause describes procedures to support roaming and federation. In\\nthis document, roaming and federation are distinguished as follows.\\n\\nRoaming is a scenario where a UE is served by a visited PLMN. The UE may\\nbe served by ECS connected with the VPLMN (i.e., V-ECS). The UE may also\\nbe served by ECS connected with the HPLMN (i.e., H-ECS) via local\\nbreakout (see clause 6.2a.2) or via home-routed session (see clause\\n6.2a.3).\\n\\nFederation is a scenario where a UE consumes edge services involving two\\nor more ECSPs. The architecture for federation support is described in\\nclause 6.2b. Different ECSP\\'s ECSs are connected by EDGE-10 and exchange\\nECS configuration information and EDN configuration information. A UE\\nmay consume federation services while non-roaming or roaming.\\n\\n8.17.2 Procedures\\n\\n8.17.2.1 General\\n\\nFollowing sets of procedures are defined to support roaming and\\nfederation:\\n\\n- Registration;\\n\\n- ECS discovery via ECS-ER; and\\n\\n- Service provisioning information retrieval.\\n\\n8.17.2.2 Registration\\n\\n8.17.2.2.1 General\\n\\nFollowing procedures are defined for ECS registration:\\n\\n- ECS registration procedure;\\n\\n- ECS registration update procedure; and\\n\\n- ECS de-registration.\\n\\n8.17.2.2.2 ECS registration\\n\\nECS registers with the ECS-ER and provides the information included in\\nthe ECS profile. Figure 8.17.2.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The ECS has the address (e.g. URI) of the ECS-ER.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.17.2.2.2-1: ECS registration procedure\\n\\n1. The ECS sends the ECS registration request to the ECS-ER. The request\\nfrom the ECS includes ECS profile and security credentials. The request\\nmay include a proposed expiration time for the registration, and may\\ninclude list of partner ECSPs that are allowed to receive its\\ninformation. The request may also include DNN and S-NSSAI information\\nfor roaming UEs to establish an LBO PDU session with the ECS as\\nspecified in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.548\\xa0[20].\\n\\n2. Upon receiving the request from the ECS, the ECS-ER verifies the\\nsecurity credentials of the ECS and stores the ECS registration\\ninformation received in step 1.\\n\\n3. The ECS-ER sends an ECS registration response indicating success or\\nfailure of the registration operation. The ECS-ER may provide an\\nexpiration time to indicate to the ECS when the registration will\\nautomatically expire. To maintain the registration, the ECS sends a\\nregistration update request prior to the expiration time. If a\\nregistration update request is not received prior to the expiration\\ntime, the ECS-ER treats the ECS as implicitly de-registered.\\n\\n8.17.2.2.3 ECS registration update \\n\\nFigure 8.17.2.2.3-1 illustrates the ECS registration update procedure.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The ECS is registered with the ECS-ER.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.17.2.2.3-1: ECS registration update procedure\\n\\n1. The ECS sends the ECS registration update request to the ECS-ER. The\\nrequest from the ECS includes security credentials and may include\\nupdated ECS profile that may include updated DNN and S-NSSAI\\ninformation, and an updated list of partner ECSPs that are allowed to\\nreceive its information. The request may also include a proposed\\nexpiration time for the updated registration.\\n\\n2. Upon receiving the request from the ECS, the ECS-ER verifies the\\nsecurity credentials of the ECS and updates the stored the ECS\\nregistration information as received in step 1.\\n\\n3. The ECS-ER sends an ECS registration update response indicating\\nsuccess or failure of the registration update operation. The ECS-ER may\\nprovide an updated expiration time to indicate to the ECS when the\\nupdated registration will automatically expire. To maintain the\\nregistration, the ECS sends another registration update request prior to\\nthe expiration time. If a registration update request is not received\\nprior to the expiration time, the ECS-ER treats the ECS as implicitly\\nde-registered.\\n\\n8.17.2.2.4 ECS de-registration \\n\\nFigure 8.17.2.2.4-1 illustrates the ECS de-registration procedure.\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. The ECS is registered with the ECS-ER.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.17.2.2.4-1: ECS de-registration procedure\\n\\n1. The ECS sends the ECS de-registration request to the ECS-ER. The\\nrequest from the ECS includes its security credentials.\\n\\n2. Upon receiving the request from the ECS, the ECS-ER verifies the\\nsecurity credentials of the ECS and de-registers the ECS.\\n\\n3. The ECS-ER sends an ECS de-registration response indicating success\\nor failure of the de-registration operation.\\n\\n8.17.2.3 ECS discovery via ECS-ER\\n\\n8.17.2.3.1 General\\n\\nFollowing procedures are supported for ECS discovery via ECS-ER:\\n\\n- Request-response procedure;\\n\\n- Subscribe-notify procedures, including:\\n\\n- Subscription procedure;\\n\\n- Notification procedure;\\n\\n- Subscription update procedure; and\\n\\n- Unsubscribe procedure.\\n\\n8.17.2.3.2 Request-response model\\n\\nWhen required to find a suitable partner ECS, the ECS queries the ECS-ER\\nby providing information such as the location of the UE, applications\\nrequired by the UE etc. In response the ECS-ER provides ECS profile of\\npartner ECS(s) providing the required application at the location\\nindicated by the ECS.

Application information sharing between ECSPs\\n\\nEditor\\'s note: The security aspect between ECS-ER (ECSP-B) and ECS-ER\\n(ECSP-A) is FFS and needs to be studied by SA3.\\n\\nEditor\\'s note: whether more procedures & operations are needed between\\nECS-ERs is FFS.\\n\\n8.18.2.2.1 General\\n\\nTo exchange EES and application information between ECSPs, allowed by\\nthe federation agreement for the purpose of ENS, the procedures defined\\nin clause 8.17 are used.\\n\\nWhen the ECS determines to query a partner ECSP for the purpose of ENS,\\ne.g., upon receiving a service provisioning request from the EEC as\\nspecified in clause 8.3 or periodically, the ECS uses -\\n\\n- the procedures defined in clause 8.17.2.3, if it needs to obtain or\\nsubscribe for ECS information of partner ECSP; and\\n\\n- the procedures defined in clause 8.17.2.4, to obtain or subscribe for\\nthe EES information from the partner ECS.\\n\\nTo obtain EES and application information using\\n\\n- a request-response model the procedures defined in clause\\n8.17.2.4.2.2.\\n\\n- a subscribe-notify model the procedures defined in clause\\n8.17.2.4.2.3.\\n\\nIf the query was initiated as a result of a service provisioning request\\nfrom the EEC as specified in clause 8.3.3.2.2, the service provisioning\\nresponse to the EEC includes EES information of the partner ECSP along\\nwith the EES information of the ECSP serving the UE. The EES of the ECSP\\nserving the UE is determined based on SLA(s) between the ECSPs such that\\nit can be authorized by the EES of the partner ECSP. The endpoint of EES\\nof partner ECSP is provided by the ECS in a way that is transparent to\\nEEC.\\n\\n8.18.2.3 EAS discovery for ENS\\n\\n8.18.2.3.1 General\\n\\nFollowing procedures are defined for EAS discovery with respect to ENS:\\n\\n- EAS discovery via leading ECSP;\\n\\n- EEC triggered EAS discovery via partner ECSP; and\\n\\n- EES triggered EAS discovery via partner ECSP.\\n\\n8.18.2.3.2 EAS discovery via leading ECSP\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1. ECSP-1 and ECSP-2 have a service level agreement to share edge\\nservices.\\n\\nFigure\\xa08.18.2.3.2-1: EAS discovery for ENS\\n\\n1. The EEC sends EAS discovery request to EES (ECSP-B) as specified in\\nclause 8.5 and may include the endpoint of EES (ECSP-A) in the request,\\nif provided by the ECS as specified in clause 8.18.2.2.1.\\n\\n2. If the EAS discovery request contains EES information of a partner\\nECSP (ECSP-A) or the required EAS is not available with the EES the EES\\nmay determine to use ENS. If the EAS discovery request contains EES\\ninformation of a partner ECSP, the EES can use it after validating the\\ninformation.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa01: To validate the information of partner ECSPs, EES (ECSP-B) can\\nuse the federation agreement between ECSPs.\\n\\n3. If the EAS discovery request does not contain EES information of a\\npartner ECSP, the EES may use the EES retrieval procedures as specified\\nin clause 8.8.3.3 to obtain EES information of a partner ECSP. The\\nRetrieve EES request may include an ENS indication so that the ECS\\n(ECSP-B) can skip checking T-EES(s) locally registered in the ECS\\n(ECSP-B).\\n\\n4. Once EES information of the partner ECSP is available, the EES\\n(ECSP-B) sends the EAS discovery request to the EES (ECSP-A) as\\ndescribed in step 3 of clause 8.8.3.2. The EAS discovery request\\nincludes the information of the MNO serving the UE (e.g. MNO name, PLMN\\nID).\\n\\nThe EES (ECSP-A) validates the request and returns EAS discovery\\nresponse including the discovered candidate EAS(s) to the EES (ECSP-B).\\nIn addition to step 4 of clause 8.8.3.2, the candidate EAS(s) are\\ndiscovered based on the serving MNO information received from the EES\\n(ECSP-B) and allowed MNO information registered by the EAS.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa02: To validate the EAS discovery request, EES (ECSP-A) can use the\\nfederation agreement between ECSPs.\\n\\n5. EES (ECSP-B) provides the discovered information to the EEC as part\\nof the EAS discovery response as specified in clause 8.5.\\n\\n8.18.2.3.3 EAS discovery via Partner ECSP, EEC triggered\\n\\nIf the EEC has the EES information of the partner ECSP and the required\\nsecurity credentials to communicate with the partner ECSP, the EEC can\\nuse the EAS discovery procedures specified in clause 8.5 to directly\\nobtain the EAS information from the EES of the partner ECSP. Upon\\nreceiving the request from the EEC, the EES of the partner ECSP\\nidentifies the EAS(s) considering the allowed MNO information of the\\nregistered EASs and UE’s serving MNO information.\\n\\n8.18.2.3.4 EAS discovery via Partner ECSP, EES triggered\\n\\nWhen service continuity is required, the EES can trigger the T-EAS\\ndiscovery procedures as defined in clause 8.8.3.2 with the EES of the\\npartner ECSP to find an EAS with respect to ENS. The EAS discovery\\nrequest includes UE\\'’s serving MNO information (e.g. MNO name, PLMN ID).\\nUpon receiving the request from the S-EES, the T-EES of the partner ECSP\\nidentifies the EAS(s) considering the allowed MNO information of the\\nregistered EASs and UE\\'s serving MNO information.\\n\\n8.18.3 APIs\\n\\n8.18.3.1 General\\n\\nThe APIs as defined in clause\\xa08.5.4 are used to perform EAS discovery in\\npartner ECSP.\\n\\nSee clause\\xa08.18.2.3.2, clause\\xa08.18.2.3.3 and clause\\xa08.18.2.3.4 for\\ndetails of usage of this operation.\\n\\n8.19 Common EAS announcement\\n\\n8.19.1 General\\n\\nCommon EAS announcement procedure enables an EES to exchange selected\\ncommon EAS information with other EES(s).\\n\\n8.19.2 Procedure\\n\\nPre-conditions:\\n\\n1.

Use of non-dedicated DN\\n\\nThere is no Edge-dedicated DN for support of edge computing service. A\\nDN common to other services (e.g. internet access) is used to connect to\\nthe EASs.\\n\\nThe PLMN supporting edge computing services provides connection to EASs\\nlocated in EDNs that respectively corresponds to one or more DNAI(s),\\nand each EDN is identified by DNN and one or more DNAI. UEs establishing\\nPDU sessions for the EASs identify the DN using the same DNN and slice\\ninformation as for PDU sessions for non-Edge services.\\n\\nEach EAS and EES can have a topological service area or a geographical\\nservice area that the EAS and EES serves, respectively. Within this\\nservice area, UEs can access an EAS or an EES regardless of their\\nlocation within the PLMN area via local breakout.\\n\\nFigure\\xa0A.2.2-1: Option 1: Use of non-dedicated DN\\n\\nA.2.3 Option 2. Use of Edge-dedicated DN \\n\\nThe deployment uses Edge-dedicated DNs for support of edge computing\\nservice. Each Edge-dedicated DN is configured with unique DNNs.\\n\\nThe PLMN supporting edge computing services provides connection to\\nseveral EDNs that correspond to one or more DNAI(s), and each EDN is\\nidentified by DNN of the Edge-dedicated DN and one or more DNAI.\\n\\nFigure\\xa0A.2.3-1: Option 2: Use of Edge-dedicated DN\\n\\nA.2.4 Option 3. Use of LADN \\n\\nEdge computing services can be provided via Edge-dedicated Data Networks\\ndeployed as LADNs. With this option, the PLMN supports edge computing\\nservices in the EDN service areas which is equal to the LADN service\\narea. The LADN service area is the service area that the Edge Computing\\nis supported. Each individual EAS in the LADN can support the same or\\nsmaller service area than the LADN.\\n\\nFigure\\xa0A.2.4-1: Option 3: Use of LADN(s)\\n\\nA.3 ECS deployments in relation to the UE\\n\\nA.3.1 General\\n\\nThis clause shows some examples for how the ECS can be deployed in\\nrelation to the UE\\n\\nA.3.2 UE (EEC) served by a single ECS\\n\\nIn this scenario the UE can contain a single AC or multiple ACs, however\\nthe UE contains a single EEC which is configured with the address of a\\nsingle ECS. This could for example be an IoT device that only supports a\\nsingle AC or a smartphone device which contains many ACs which are\\nserved by a single ECS.\\n\\nA.3.3 UE (EECs) served by multiple ECSs\\n\\nIn this scenario the user is allowed to install multiple ACs in the UE\\nwhere each AC can be served by an EAS which in turn served by a\\ndifferent ECSP\\'s EES/ECS.\\n\\nOne example is that multiple ACs are installed on a smartphone and the\\nassociated EASs are on-boarded onto different ECSP\\'s EESs which are\\nregistered with different ECSs.\\n\\nAnother example is a UE that supports Dual SIM. In this scenario the UE\\ncan support concurrent connection to two PLMNs.\\n\\nA.4 Deployment of EES in relation with SEAL services and Application Enabler Services\\n\\nA.4.1 General\\n\\nThe illustration of layered application architecture with the generic\\nSEAL and Application Enabler server functions available in the cloud is\\nshown in Figure\\xa0A.4.1-1.\\n\\nFigure\\xa0A.4.1-1: Illustration of a layered application architecture with\\ngeneric SEAL and Application Enabler server functions available in the\\ncloud\\n\\nThe examples of application specific client are V2X application specific\\nclient, FF application specific client, UAS application specific client\\nor other vertical application specific client residing on the UE.\\nSimilarly, the application specific server could be e.g. V2X application\\nspecific server, FF application specific server, UAS application\\nspecific server or other vertical application specific server.\\n\\nThe UE may consist of an application enabler client. The examples of\\napplication enabler client include V2X application enabler client, FF\\napplication enabler client, UAS application enabler client or other\\nvertical application enabler client residing on the UE. Similarly, the\\napplication enabler server could be V2X application enabler server, FF\\napplication enabler Server, UAS application enabler server or other\\nvertical application enabler server.\\n\\nThe illustration of layered application architecture with generic SEAL\\nand Application Enabler server functions available in the edge is shown\\nin Figure\\xa0A.4.1-2.\\n\\nFigure\\xa0A.4.1-2: Illustration of layered application architecture with\\ngeneric SEAL and Application Enabler server functions available in the\\nedge\\n\\nWhile the server functions of an application specific server can be made\\navailable only as an EAS, it is also possible that certain application\\nspecific server functions are available both at the edge and in the\\ncloud. Similarly, the server functions of an application enabler server\\ncan be made available only as an EAS, it is also possible that certain\\napplication enabler server functions are available both at the edge and\\nin the cloud. When the server functions of an application are both\\navailable at the edge and the cloud, there may be a need for interaction\\nbetween the two corresponding application servers, which is out of scope\\nof this specification.\\n\\nNOTE 1: The details of a specific vertical application architecture\\nbased on the generic layered application architecture with server\\nfunctions of an application available in the edge and the cloud is out\\nof scope of this specification.\\n\\nNOTE 2: When UE is in the coverage of the EDN due to which certain\\nserver functions are available both at the edge and in the cloud, then\\nwhether UE connects to the server functions available at the edge or\\ndirectly to the cloud is out of scope of the present document.\\n\\nA.4.2 Deployment of SEAL services\\n\\nThere are several options to support SEAL service APIs to be exposed to\\nthe EAS.\\n\\nThe EES can act as the CAPIF core function, and the SEAL servers acting\\nthe AEF and publish the SEAL service API to the EES.

The CES is part of the EEL and it does not have service area restriction. CES facilitates service continuity between EAS and CAS. Functionalities of the CES are: a)\\tproviding access to network capability information (e.g. location information) to the CAS; b)\\tfacilitating setup of a data session between AC and CAS with a specific QoS; and c)\\tsupporting ACR related operations. 6.3.10\\tCloud application server (CAS) CAS is the application server resident in the cloud, performing the server functions. The AC connects to the CAS in order to avail the services of the application. 6.4\\tService-based interfaces The architecture for enabling edge applications contains the following service-based interfaces: Eecs:\\tService-based interface exhibited by ECS. Eees:\\tService-based interface exhibited by EES. 6.5\\tReference Points 6.5.1\\tGeneral This clause describes the reference points of the architecture for enabling edge applications. 6.5.2\\tEDGE-1 EDGE-1 reference point enables interactions between the EES and the EEC. It supports: a)\\tregistration and de-registration of the EEC to the EES; b)\\tretrieval and provisioning of EAS configuration information; c)\\tdiscovery of EASs available in the EDN; and d)\\tservice continuity procedures (e.g. ACR initiation). 6.5.3\\tEDGE-2 EDGE-2 reference point enables interactions between the EES and the 3GPP Core Network functions and APIs for retrieval of network capability information. It supports: access via SCEF and NEF APIs as defined in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2], 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.502\\xa0[3], 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa029.522\\xa0[4], 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.682\\xa0[17], 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa029.122\\xa0[5]; or direct access to core network functions with the EES deployed within the MNO trust domain (see 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2] clause\\xa05.13, 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.503\\xa0[12], 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.682\\xa0[17]). NOTE:\\tEDGE-2 reference point reuses 3GPP reference points or interfaces of EPS or 5GS considering different deployment models. 6.5.4\\tEDGE-3 EDGE-3 reference point enables interactions between the EES and the EASs. It supports: a)\\tregistration of EASs with availability information (e.g. time constraints, location constraints); b)\\tde-registration of EASs from the EES; c)\\tdiscovery of T-EAS information to support ACT; d)\\tproviding access to network capability information (e.g. location information); e)\\trequesting the setup of a data session between AC and EAS with a specific QoS and receiving QoS related information; and f)\\tservice continuity procedures (e.g. ACR status). NOTE:\\tOptimized distribution of events across the EDGE-3 interface is out of scope of this specification. 6.5.5\\tEDGE-4 EDGE-4 reference point enables interactions between the ECS and the EEC.

              " Document(page_content=\"The edge computing capabilities supported by 3GPP are illustrated in the figure\\xa04.1-1. Figure\\xa04.1-1: Overview of 3GPP edge computing The application layer is a consumer of 3GPP specified edge computing capabilities. The 3GPP edge computing capabilities are typically organized as follows: Edge enabler layer, specified in this specification; Edge hosting environment, details of which are outside the scope of 3GPP; 3GPP transport layer, specified in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.401\\xa0[11] and 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2]; and Edge management layer, specified in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa028.538 [22]. Following clauses provide an overview of the features of edge enabler layer. The edge computing features defined in this specification are applicable to PLMN(s) and to SNPN(s) as 3GPP transport layer. In this specification, when PLMN is mentioned, it is also applicable for SNPN unless stated otherwise. 4.2\\tService provisioning Service provisioning procedures supply the information required by the UE to access the edge services. The procedure takes UE's location, service requirements, service preferences and connectivity information into account to provide the required configuration. Service provisioning procedures are specified in clause\\xa08.3. 4.3\\tRegistration Registration procedures specified in clause 8.4, allow entities (e.g. UE and Application Server) in the edge enabler layer to provide information about itself to other entities of the edge enabler layer. 4.4\\tEAS discovery EAS discovery procedures enable the UE to obtain information about suitable EASs of interest (specified as discovery filters) in the EDN. EAS discovery procedures are specified in clause\\xa08.5. 4.5\\tCapability exposure to EAS and EEC The edge enabler layer exposes services towards the EASs and EECs. The exposed capabilities include the services of the Edge Enabler Layer and the re-exposed and enhanced services of the 3GPP core network. The capabilities exposed by the edge enabler layer are specified in clause\\xa08.6 and the 3GPP network capability exposure is specified in clause\\xa08.7. Other application layer capabilities like application enabler services and SEAL services may be exposed via edge enabler layer as per CAPIF as illustrated in Annex A.4. The edge enabler layer also supports for an EAS to expose its Service APIs (i.e., EAS Service APIs) towards the other EASs via CAPIF as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6] by deploying CAPIF core function within the EES to support publish and discovery of EAS Service APIs. The details are provided in Annex A.5.4. 4.6\\tSupport for service continuity When a UE moves to a new location, different EASs can be more suitable for serving the UE. When no suitable EAS can be found for serving the UE, the service session may transition to a CAS. Such transitions can result from a non-mobility event also, requiring support from the edge enabler layer to maintain the continuity of the service. Support for service continuity provides several features for minimizing the application layer service interruption by replacing the S-EAS connected to the AC in the UE, with a T-EAS or CAS. Support for service continuity is further specified in clause\\xa08.8. 4.7\\tSecurity The edge enabler layer supports secure communication amongst the enabler layer entities. Clause\\xa08.11 provides details on EEC authentication and authorization. 4.8\\tDynamic EAS instantiation triggering The Edge Enabler Layer can interact with the ECSP management system to trigger instantiation of a suitable EAS as per application needs.

This representation also includes point-to-point reference points where necessary; A service-based representation as specified in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2], where the Network Functions (e.g. NEF) enable authorized Edge Enabler Layer functions (e.g. ECS) i.e. Application Functions, to access their services; A service-based representation, where the Core Network Northbound APIs as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], are utilized by authorized Edge Enabler Layer functions via CAPIF core function specified in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.222\\xa0[6]; and A reference point representation, where existing interactions between any two functions (e.g. EES, ECS) is shown by an appropriate point-to-point reference point (e.g. EDGE-6, EDGE-7). Edge Enabler Layer functions shown in the service-based representation of the edge architecture shall only use service-based interfaces for their interactions. Figure\\xa06.2-1 illustrates the service based representation of architecture for enabling edge applications. Figure\\xa06.2-1: Architecture for enabling edge applications - service-based representation NOTE:\\tThe EEC function and EAS function in figure\\xa06.2-1 do not expose any service to the other functions. The mechanisms for service discovery in the service-based representation depicted in figure\\xa06.2-1 are as follows: The EES discovers the ECS via pre-configuration or by using CAPIF as specified in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.222\\xa0[6]; The EAS discovers the EES via pre-configuration or by using CAPIF as specified in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.222\\xa0[6]; The EAS discovers the other EAS(s) as specified in clause\\xa08.8.3.2; The EEC discovers the ECS as specified in clause\\xa08.3.2; and The EEC discovers the EES via service provisioning as specified in clause\\xa08.3.3. Figure\\xa06.2-2 illustrates the service-based representation for utilization of the 5GS network services based on the 5GS SBA specified in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[2]. Figure\\xa06.2-2: Utilization of 5GS network services based on the 5GS SBA – service based representation The ECS, EES and EAS act as AFs for consuming network services from the 3GPP 5G Core Network entities over the Service Based Architecture specified in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[7]. Figure\\xa06.2-3 illustrates the service-based representation for utilization of the Core Network (5GC, EPC) northbound APIs via CAPIF. Figure\\xa06.2-3: Utilization of Core Network Northbound APIs via CAPIF – service based representation The ECS, EES and EAS act as authorized API invoker to consume services from the Core Network (5GC, EPC) northbound API entities like SCEF, NEF, SCEF+NEF which act as API Exposing Function as specified in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.222\\xa0[6]. The mechanism for northbound APIs discovery using the service-based interfaces depicted in figure\\xa06.2-3 is as specified in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.222\\xa0[6]. Figure\\xa06.2-4 illustrates the reference point representation of the architecture for edge enabling applications. Figure\\xa06.2-4: Architecture for enabling edge applications - reference points representation The EDN is a local Data Network. EAS(s) and the EES are contained within the EDN. The ECS provides configurations related to the EES, including details of the EDN hosting the EES. The UE contains AC(s) and the EEC. The EAS(s), the EES and the ECS can interact with the 3GPP Core Network. When SEAL notification management service is used, the EES and the ECS interact with the SEAL notification management server and the SEAL EEC interacts with SEAL Notification management client. 6.2a\\tArchitecture for Roaming support 6.2a.1\\tGeneral This clause describes the architectures for roaming UEs. To support UEs that are roaming, the EEL uses ECSs provided in HPLMN and VPLMN. The EEC in the UE obtains edge enabler layer services from V-ECS and V-EES. EDGE-10 reference point is used between the H-ECS and the V-ECS. Two roaming models are supported for edge enabling applications: Local breakout (LBO)roaming architecture; and Home routed (HR) roaming architecture. In both architecture options, the EDN is located in the V-PLMN and is accessed via an LBO or HR-SBO session. NOTE:\\tH-ECS, H-EES and V-ECS, V-EES can be provided by the same ECSP. 6.2a.2\\tLocal breakout roaming architecture: Local breakout to access H-ECS Figure 6.2a.2-1 shows the roaming architecture for enabling edge applications as the reference point representation when the local breakout (LBO) PDU Session is used for routing EDGE-4 traffic between the EEC and the H-ECS. Figure\\xa06.2a.2-1: Architecture for enabling edge applications for local breakout roaming scenarios  6.2a.3\\tHome-routed EDGE-4 access to H-ECS Figure 6.2a.3-1 shows the roaming architecture for enabling edge applications as the reference point representation when the home routed (HR) PDU Session is used for routing EDGE-4 traffic between the EEC and the H-ECS. The traffic toward the EDN of the VPLMN (i.e. EDGE-1 traffic and application data traffic) is not routed via the HPLMN while the traffic between the EEC and H-ECS is routed via VPLMN toward HPLMN. Such a local access to the EDN of the VPLMN in the scenario is supported when a home routed session breakout (HR-SBO) PDU Session is used as described in clause 6.7 of 3GPP TS 23.548 [20]. Figure\\xa06.2a.3-1: Architecture for enabling edge applications for home routed roaming scenarios  6.2b\\tArchitecture for Federation support 6.2b.1\\tGeneral This clause describes the architecture for support of Federation. To support Federation, EDGE-10 reference point is used between the ECSs to exchange ECS profile and EDN configuration information. NOTE:\\tECS profile of partner ECSs can be preconfigured in the ECS or can be configured by the OAM system. For cases where the preconfigured and OAM configured information is not sufficient or not available, the ECS may communicate with other ECSs, e.g. ECS with edge repository functionality, to obtain the information. If the ECSP is required to support service provisioning for a certain EAS whose information is not within the pre-configuration or OAM configuration, the ECS can use Edge repository functions as defined in clause 6.3.4 to support ECS discovery via ECS-ER. 6.2b.2\\tArchitecture  Figure\\xa06.2b.2-1 shows the architecture for support of federation. EDGE-10 reference point is introduced between the ECSs. ECSs interfacing over EDGE-10 reference point can be provided by different or the same ECSP. EDGE-10 interface is used for exchange of EDN configuration information. When one of the ECS is enhanced as an edge repository (ECS-ER) as defined in clause 6.3.4, making it the center of information for edge deployments, the ECS-ER receives information about edge deployments from other ECSs and stores it. In such deployments, EDGE-10 interface is used both for exchanging of ECS profile during ECS discovery and for exchanging EDN configuration information during service provisioning information retrieval. Figure\\xa06.2b.2-1: Architecture for Federation support 6.2c\\tArchitecture for enabling cloud applications with edge applications Figure\\xa06.2c-1 illustrates the architecture for enabling cloud applications along with the edge applications. Figure\\xa06.2c-1: Architecture for enabling cloud application with edge applications Cloud application server (CAS) residing outside the EDN may need to interact with the EEL entities e.g. for service continuity. The CAS and EAS interaction is Application Data Traffic, which is out-of-scope of this specification. 6.2d\\tArchitecture for enabling cloud applications with edge applications, with CES support Figure\\xa06.2d-1 illustrates the architecture for enabling cloud applications along with the edge applications, when CES is used. NOTE:\\tEdge and cloud servers can utilize SEAL NM service but for simplicity such an interaction is not depicted in the figure. Figure\\xa06.2d-1: Architecture for enabling cloud application with edge applications Cloud Application Server (CAS) residing in the cloud DN may need to interact with the Cloud Enabler Server (CES) which is part of the EEL for interworking, e.g. for service continuity. The CAS and EAS interaction is Application Data Traffic, which is out-of-scope of this specification. 6.3\\tFunctional entities 6.3.1\\tGeneral This clause describes the functional entities of the architecture for enabling edge applications. 6.3.2\\tEdge Enabler Server (EES) EES provides supporting functions needed for EASs and EEC. Functionalities of EES are: a)\\tprovisioning of configuration information to EEC, enabling exchange of application data traffic with the EAS; b)\\tproviding API invoker and API exposing functions as specified in 3GPP\\xa0TS\\xa023.222\\xa0[6].
